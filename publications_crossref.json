It converts any kind of biomass into biochar, bio-oil, or biogas. Hence plants\u2019 woody material can also be converted into bioenergy products. Valorization of woody biomass in the form of energy-rich compound biochar is a more sustainable technique as compared to conventional burning which leads to toxicity to the environment. Innovations and the need to limit open burning have resulted in numerous mobile and fixed plant pyrolysis methods that burn a variety of woody residues. Production technologies that reduce the need for open burning, the main source of potential pollutants, fall under the regulations in the Clean Air Act of 1990. This Act is the legal instrument to regulate air pollution at its source across the United States of America and it is implemented and enforced through the Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with sister agencies. One newer innovation for reducing wood residues and emissions is an air curtain incinerator. Currently, the Clean Air Act regulates stationary solid waste incinerators, and this is also applied to mobile air curtain incinerators burning woody biomass. However, other woody biochar production methods (e.g., flame cap kilns) are not subjected to these regulations. Discrepancies in the interpretation of definitions related to incineration and pyrolysis and the myriad of differences related to stationary and mobile air curtain incinerators, type of waste wood from construction activities, forest residues, and other types of clean wood make the permit regulations confusing as permits can vary by jurisdiction. This review summarizes the current policies, regulations, and directives related to in-woods biochar production and the required permits.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Forests"]},{"DOI":"10.1097\/ms9.0000000000001734","title":["SOFA and APACHE II scoring systems for predicting outcome of neurological patients admitted in a tertiary hospital intensive care unit"],"author":[{"given":"Sumit","family":"Shahi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Hem","family":"Paneru","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Rajeev","family":"Ojha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Ragesh","family":"Karn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Reema","family":"Rajbhandari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Bikram Prasad","family":"Gajurel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, Maharajgunj Medical Campus, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu, 44600, Nepal"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Background:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The field of neurology encompasses the study and treatment of disorders that affect the nervous system, and patients with neurological conditions often require specialized care, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU).

However, they never saw the same reception in technical applications as the Fe-Si or Fe-Ni alloys, which is, to some extent, due to a low ductility level and difficulties in manufacturing. Additive manufacturing (AM) technology could be a way to avoid issues in conventional manufacturing and produce soft magnetic components from these alloys, as has already been shown with similarly brittle Fe-Si alloys. While AM has already been applied to certain Fe-Al alloys, no magnetic properties of AM Fe-Al alloys have been reported in the literature so far. Therefore, in this work, a Fe-12Al alloy was additively manufactured through laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and characterized regarding its microstructure and magnetic properties. A comparison was made with the materials produced by casting and rolling, prepared from melts with an identical chemical composition. In order to improve the magnetic properties, a heat treatment at a higher temperature (1300 \u00b0C) than typically applied for conventionally manufactured materials (850\u20131150 \u00b0C) is proposed for the AM material. The specially heat-treated AM material reached values (HC: 11.3 A\/m; \u00b5max: 13.1 \u00d7 103) that were close to the heat-treated cast material (HC: 12.4 A\/m; \u00b5max: 20.3 \u00d7 103). While the DC magnetic values of hot- and cold-rolled materials (HC: 3.2 to 4.1 A\/m; \u00b5max: 36.6 to 40.4 \u00d7 103) were not met, the AM material actually showed fewer losses than the rolled material under AC conditions. One explanation for this effect can be domain refinement effects. This study shows that it is possible to additively manufacture Fe-Al alloys with good soft magnetic behavior. With optimized manufacturing and post-processing, further improvements of the magnetic properties of AM L-PBF Fe-12Al may still be possible.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Metals"]},{"DOI":"10.1145\/3626098","title":["Robust Embedded Autonomous Driving Positioning System Fusing LiDAR and Inertial Sensors"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1735-2331","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Zhijian","family":"He","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}]},{"given":"Bohuan","family":"Xue","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}]},{"given":"Xiangcheng","family":"Hu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}]},{"given":"Zhaoyan","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Shandong University, China"}]},{"given":"Xiangyue","family":"Zeng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sun Yat-Sen University, China"}]},{"given":"Ming","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Autonomous driving emphasizes precise multi-sensor fusion positioning on limit resource embedded systems. LiDAR-centered sensor fusion system serves as a mainstream navigation system due to its insensitivity to illumination and viewpoint change. However, these types of systems suffer from handling large-scale sequential LiDAR data using limited resources on board, leading LiDAR-centralized sensor fusion unpractical. As a result, hand-crafted features such as plane and edge are leveraged in majority mainstream positioning methods to alleviate this unsatisfaction, triggering a new cornerstone in LiDAR Inertial sensor fusion. However, such super light weight feature extraction, although it achieves real-time constraint in LiDAR-centered sensor fusion, encounters severe vulnerability under high speed rotational or translational perturbation. In this paper, we propose a sparse tensor based LiDAR Inertial fusion method for autonomous driving embedded system. Leveraging the power of sparse tensor, the global geometrical feature is fetched so that the point cloud sparsity defect is alleviated. Inertial sensor is deployed to conquer the time-consuming step caused by the coarse level point-wise inlier matching. We construct our experiments on both representative dataset benchmarks and realistic scenes.

Postharvest losses due to fungal disease are a major economic concern for growers. In the summer of 2019, a leaf spot was observed in postharvest shipments of sweet basil destined for Europe; in late winter of 2022, leaf spots were observed on greenhouse-grown sweet basil. Fungal isolates from infected leaves were characterized by morphology in culture as Alternaria spp. PCR amplification of the Alternaria major allergen Alt a1, ITS, and gdp gene regions of the recovered isolates confirmed the presence of A. alternata, a common pathogen of numerous herbs and spice plants. In vitro growth tests demonstrated that 25\u00b0C was the optimum temperature for growth of the isolates. The isolates were tested for pathogenicity and found to infect a commonly grown cultivar of basil, cultivar Eli (previously cultivar Perrie). Foliar symptoms in pathogenicity tests were identical to those observed in commercial shipments and in the field, which completed Koch\u2019s postulates.

RESULTS: Here, our investigation shows the complex changes in gene expression on days 2 and 3\u00a0post-infection. The functional analysis showed that especially related to immune response, response to other organisms, and defense response. IL6-AS1 is the predicted long non-coding RNA and is a key regulator during infection. In this study, for the first time has been reported the role of IL6-AS1.

The proposed strategy, with state of charge as the balancing variable, represents the topological structure of the circuit in the form of graph by adopting graph theory control, seeks the optimal equalization path via ant colony optimization algorithm with global search, thus to improve the equalization speed and efficiency.

phenotype and functions, which has been associated with differences in their ontogeny. Despite extensive research, our understanding of the precise role of different subsets of macrophages in ischemia\/reperfusion injury remains incomplete. We here investigated macrophage lineages and ablated tissue macrophages in homeostasis and after I\/R injury in a CSF1R-dependent manner. Genomic deletion of a fms-intronic regulatory element (FIRE) in the Csf1r locus resulted in specific absence of resident homeostatic and antigen-presenting macrophages, without affecting the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages to the infarcted heart. Specific absence of homeostatic, monocyte-independent macrophages altered the immune cell crosstalk in response to injury and induced proinflammatory neutrophil polarization, resulting in impaired cardiac remodelling without influencing infarct size. In contrast, continuous CSF1R inhibition led to depletion of both resident and recruited macrophage populations. This augmented adverse remodelling after I\/R and led to an increased infarct size and deterioration of cardiac function. In summary, resident macrophages orchestrate inflammatory responses improving cardiac remodelling, while recruited macrophages determine infarct size after I\/R injury.

The pair Myc:Max binds to E-box regulatory DNA elements throughout the genome to control the transcription of a large group of specific genes. We introduce an implicit modeling protocol for Myc:Max binding to mesoscale chromatin fibers at nucleosome resolution to determine TF effect on chromatin architecture and shed light into its mechanism of gene regulation. We first bind Myc:Max to different chromatin locations and show how it can direct fiber folding and formation of microdomains, and how this depends on the linker DNA length. Second, by simulating increasing concentrations of Myc:Max binding to fibers that differ in the DNA linker length, linker histone density, and acetylation levels, we assess the interplay between Myc:Max and other chromatin internal parameters. Third, we study the mechanism of gene silencing by Myc:Max binding to the Eed gene loci. Overall, our results show how chromatin architecture can be regulated by TF binding. The position of TF binding dictates the formation of microdomains that appear visible only at the ensemble level. At the same time, the level of linker histone and tail acetylation, or different linker DNA lengths, regulates the concentration-dependent effect of TF binding. Furthermore, we show how TF binding can repress gene expression by increasing fiber folding motifs that help compact and occlude the promoter region. Importantly, this effect can be reversed by increasing linker histone density. Overall, these results shed light on the epigenetic control of the genome dictated by TF binding.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["eLife"]},{"DOI":"10.2196\/49986","title":["A Nationwide Chronic Disease Management Solution via Clinical Decision Support Services: Software Development and Real-Life Implementation Report"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0825-1851","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mustafa Mahir","family":"Ulgu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6201-3849","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gokce Banu","family":"Laleci Erturkmen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4844-392X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mustafa","family":"Yuksel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1157-8994","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tuncay","family":"Namli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8835-242X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"\u015eenan","family":"Postac\u0131","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2697-5722","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mert","family":"Gencturk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7657-8886","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yildiray","family":"Kabak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4397-3382","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"A Anil","family":"Sinaci","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7352-8848","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Suat","family":"Gonul","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-1076-3112","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Asuman","family":"Dogac","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1179-2141","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Z\u00fcbeyde","family":"\u00d6zkan Altunay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0592-3950","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Banu","family":"Ekinci","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3970-5791","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sahin","family":"Aydin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8104-6198","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Suayip","family":"Birinci","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The increasing population of older adults has led to a rise in the demand for health care services, with chronic diseases being a major burden.

One of these candidate genes, <jats:italic>TMEM263<\/jats:italic>, encodes a poorly characterized plasma membrane protein. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TMEM263 are associated with bone mineral density in humans and mutations are associated with dwarfism in chicken and severe skeletal dysplasia in at least one human fetus. Whether this genotype-phenotype relationship is causal, however, remains unclear. Here, we determine whether and how TMEM263 is required for postnatal growth. Deletion of the <jats:italic>Tmem263<\/jats:italic> gene in mice causes severe postnatal growth failure, proportional dwarfism, and impaired skeletal acquisition. Mice lacking Tmem263 show no differences in body weight within the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. However, by P21 there is a dramatic growth deficit due to a disrupted growth hormone (GH)\/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis, which is critical for longitudinal bone growth. <jats:italic>Tmem263<\/jats:italic>-null mice have low circulating IGF-1 levels and pronounced reductions in bone mass and growth plate length. The low serum IGF-1 in <jats:italic>Tmem263<\/jats:italic>-null mice is associated with reduced hepatic GH receptor (GHR) expression and GH-induced JAK2\/STAT5 signaling. A deficit in GH signaling dramatically alters GH-regulated genes and feminizes the liver transcriptome of Tmem263-null male mice, with their expression profile resembling wild-type female, hypophysectomized male, and Stat5b-null male mice. Collectively, our data validates the causal role for Tmem263 in regulating postnatal growth and raises the possibility that rare mutations or variants of <jats:italic>TMEM263<\/jats:italic> may potentially cause GH insensitivity and impair linear growth.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["eLife"]},{"DOI":"10.1090\/jams\/1039","title":["A Spectral Sequence from Khovanov Homology to Knot Floer Homology"],"author":[{"given":"Nathan","family":"Dowlin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<p>A well-known conjecture of Rasmussen states that for any knot <inline-formula content-type=\"math\/mathml\">\n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" alttext=\"upper K\">\n  <mml:semantics>\n    <mml:mi>K<\/mml:mi>\n    <mml:annotation encoding=\"application\/x-tex\">K<\/mml:annotation>\n  <\/mml:semantics>\n<\/mml:math>\n<\/inline-formula> in <inline-formula content-type=\"math\/mathml\">\n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" alttext=\"upper S cubed\">\n  <mml:semantics>\n    <mml:msup>\n      <mml:mi>S<\/mml:mi>\n      <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n        <mml:mn>3<\/mml:mn>\n      <\/mml:mrow>\n    <\/mml:msup>\n    <mml:annotation encoding=\"application\/x-tex\">S^{3}<\/mml:annotation>\n  <\/mml:semantics>\n<\/mml:math>\n<\/inline-formula>, the rank of the reduced Khovanov homology of <inline-formula content-type=\"math\/mathml\">\n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" alttext=\"upper K\">\n  <mml:semantics>\n    <mml:mi>K<\/mml:mi>\n    <mml:annotation encoding=\"application\/x-tex\">K<\/mml:annotation>\n  <\/mml:semantics>\n<\/mml:math>\n<\/inline-formula> is greater than or equal to the rank of the reduced knot Floer homology of <inline-formula content-type=\"math\/mathml\">\n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" alttext=\"upper K\">\n  <mml:semantics>\n    <mml:mi>K<\/mml:mi>\n    <mml:annotation encoding=\"application\/x-tex\">K<\/mml:annotation>\n  <\/mml:semantics>\n<\/mml:math>\n<\/inline-formula>.

The BOLD signal correlated with variation in each lexical property; patterns consistent with both language-specific and domain-general mechanisms. Activation patterns at the individual level also showed that effects of phonological neighborhood and lexical frequency landed in Crus I and Crus II as the most probable sites, though there was activation seen in other lobules (especially for frequency).

The discrimination ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow tests and calibration plots.  Studied serum samples were collected from 616 participants, and 1464 metabolites were identified. Machine learning algorithm determines that androstenedione exhibited excellent discrimination and acceptable calibration in discriminating PACG across the discovery phase (discovery set 1, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] =1.0 [95%CI, 1.00-1.00]; discovery set, AUC=0.85 [95%CI, 0.80-0.90]) and validation phases (internal validation, AUC=0.86 [95%CI, 0.81-0.91]; external validation, AUC=0.87 [95%CI, 0.80-0.95]).  Androstenedione also exhibited a higher AUC (0.92-0.98) to discriminate the severity of PACG. In the supplemental phase, serum androstenedione levels were consistent with those in aqueous humor (r=0.82, P=0.038) and significantly (P=0.021) decreased after treatment. Further, cohort phase demonstrates that higher baseline androstenedione levels (hazard ratio=2.71 [95% CI: 1.199-6.104], P=0.017) were associated with faster visual field progression.

However, the microbial production of glycolate often encounters challenges associated with unbalanced metabolic flux, leading to a notably low titer. Additionally, the use of expensive inducers, such as IPTG, contributes to an increase in the overall production cost. To address these issues, the key enzymes involved in the glycolate biosynthetic route, including citrate synthase (gltA), isocitrate lyase (aceA), isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase\/phosphatase (aceK) and glyoxylate reductase (ycdW), were overexpressed in E. coli under the control of inducible promoters with varying strengths in order to determine the optimal combination. Subsequently, the glycolate pathway was further modulated by replacing inducible promoters with various constitutive synthetic promoters. Through this systematic optimization, the best strain, named Mgly4T1562, produced 3.02 g\/L glycolate with 97.32% theoretical yield in shake-flask cultivation. The titer further increased to 15.53 g\/L in a fed-batch experiment. Notably, this study marks the first successful utilization of synthetic promoters in tuning the glycolate biosynthetic pathway for glycolate biosynthesis.

An essential part of the work illustrating the potential of PR has been conducted using multi-layer ionization chamber (MLIC) detectors and mono-energetic PR.

The longitudinal distance over which all spots per field range out is significantly reduced for LTSE PR compared to mono-energetic PR.

Finally, we demonstrate the accordance of simulated and experimentally acquired IDDs for an LTSE PR acquisition. As the next steps, the framework will be used to investigate the sensitivity of LTSE PR to various sources of errors.

First, we evaluated the variability in definitions of the subpopulations across CVOTs using major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) incidence in the placebo arm as a proxy for baseline cardiovascular risk. As baseline risk did not differ considerably across CVOTs, we conducted subgroup meta-analyses of hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE and assessed the credibility of a potential effect modification.

To enhance adherence to informed consent rules in the context of medical AI, this paper advocates for a shift towards a patient\u2010centric information disclosure standard, the restructuring of medical liability rules, the augmentation of professional training, and the advancement of public understanding through educational initiatives.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Developing World Bioethics"]},{"DOI":"10.33416\/baybem.1400343","title":["EXAMINING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WITHIN  THE SCOPE OF SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE: A RESEARCH IN A\u011eRI CITY","SOSYAL G\u0130R\u0130\u015e\u0130MC\u0130L\u0130\u011eIN SOSYAL ZEKA KAPSAMINDA \u0130NCELENMES\u0130:  A\u011eRI \u0130L\u0130NDE B\u0130R ARA\u015eTIRMA"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6452-2102","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Ercan","family":"KESER","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"A\u011eRI \u0130BRAH\u0130M \u00c7E\u00c7EN \u00dcN\u0130VERS\u0130TES\u0130"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8071-3948","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hikmet","family":"SARI","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"A\u011eRI \u0130BRAH\u0130M \u00c7E\u00c7EN \u00dcN\u0130VERS\u0130TES\u0130"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Bu \u00e7al\u0131\u015fman\u0131n ba\u015fl\u0131ca amac\u0131, sosyal zek\u00e2n\u0131n sosyal giri\u015fimcilik \u00fczerindeki etkisinin belirlenmesidir.

In this study, a total of 428 samples were systematically collected from 20 distinct areas within the Qinghai Plateau. The samples included 62 ticks and 366 blood samples obtained from diverse animal species to detect the presence of Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Coxiella spp., and Borrelia spp. The prevalence of infection in this study was determined as follows: Anaplasma bovis accounted for 16.4% (70\/428), A. capra for 4.7% (20\/428), A. ovis for 5.8% (25\/428), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato for 6.3% (27\/428), Coxiella burnetii for 0.7% (3\/428), and Rickettsia spp. for 0.5% (2\/428). Notably, no cases of A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum infections were observed in this study. The findings revealed an elevated presence of these pathogens in Tibetan sheep and goats, with no infections detected in yaks, Bactrian camels, donkeys, and horses.

The control strategies for biomechanical models can effectively synergize with the central nervous system (CNS) to facilitate the desired movements of individuals with neurological disabilities. In this study, we present our novel 3D biped model by decoupling it into healthy and neurologically deficient joints. The developed 8-segment model (i.e., 2x feet, 2x shanks, 2x thighs, 1x pelvic, and 1x Head Arm Torso (HAT) segment) with 10 joints is decoupled into 6 healthy joints and 4 deficient joints. This decoupling mimics stroke patients or subjects with neuromuscular deficiency. This novel decoupling establishes through asymmetrical torques in frontal and sagittal plane joints on a bipedal design with one foot fixed and the other a sliding tilt joint. In this design, two decoupled controllers collaborate to stabilize the nonlinear model for biped STS transfer. Utilizing the xml files from SOLIDWORKS, the model is linearized in SIMSCAPE \/ SIMULINK. We further imply the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal controller design in MATLAB \/ SIMULINK for torques in both the sagittal and frontal planes, respectively, for six healthy and four deficient joints.

The present study presents the results of the 2-year surveillance project, in the city of Patras, Greece. The purpose of the study was to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and implement WBE as an early warning method of monitoring Public Health impact. The presence of SARS-CoV-2, was determined and quantified in 310 samples using RT-qPCR assays. For the years 2022 and 2023, 93,5% and 78,7% of samples were found positive, respectively. Comparison of detection methods have been conducted to select the method with the highest recovery of the viral load. A seasonal variation of the virus was recorded, showing a recession in summer months confirming the country's epidemiological data as indicated by positive correlation of wastewater viral load with registered cases of COVID-19 infections during these years (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) and moreover, sealed with a significant negative correlation observed with Daily Average (p\u2009&lt;\u20090,01) and Daily Maximum Temperature (p\u2009&lt;\u20090,01).

The deformed relativistic mean field theory in complex momentum representations with BCS pairings (DRMF-CMR-BCS), employed in our work, provides resonant states with real physics, offering insights into deformed halo nuclei. Four effective interactions (NL3, NL3$^{*}$, PK1, and NLSH) were considered to assess the influence of continuum and deformation effects on halo structures. Calculations for odd-even nuclei $^{35-43}$Na revealed the dependence on the chosen effective interaction and the number of considered resonant states. Neutron occupation patterns near the Fermi surface, particularly in orbitals $1\/2^{-}_3$ and $3\/2^{-}_2$, were found to play a crucial role in halo formation.

Although its pathogenicity is uncertain, recent studies have suggested that it may play a role in the Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) because of its capacity to replicate in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This study aimed to determine the spread of PRV1 in Northern Italy and the phylogeny of the isolates. Therefore, PRV1 was investigated using real-time RT-PCR in 902 samples collected from September 2022 to September 2023 from pigs with respiratory symptoms in North Italy. Fourteen (1.55%) samples tested as PRV1-positive. The full-length fusion (F) gene, which codifies for a major surface protein, was amplified and used for phylogenetic analysis to help carry out molecular epidemiological studies on this virus. In addition, swine influenza virus (SIV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infections were detected in most of the PRV1-positive samples.

Small mammals, such as mice and rats are common chronic, asymptomatic hosts that transmit the virus through their feces and urine. In North America, hantavirus infection primarily causes hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which has a mortality rate of nearly 36%. In the United States of America, New Mexico (NM) is leading the nation in the number of HCPS-reported cases (N = 129). However, no reported cases of HCPS have occurred within eastern NM. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in rodent assemblages across eastern NM, using RT-qPCR. We screened for potential rodent hosts in the region, as well as identified areas that may pose significant infection risk to humans. We captured and collected blood and lung tissues from 738 rodents belonging to 23 species. 167 individuals from 16 different species were positive for SNV RNA by RT-qPCR, including 6 species unreported in the literature: <jats:italic>Onychomys leucogaster<\/jats:italic> (Northern grasshopper mouse), <jats:italic>Dipodomys merriami<\/jats:italic> (Merriam\u2019s kangaroo rat), <jats:italic>Dipodomys ordii<\/jats:italic> (Ord\u2019s kangaroo rat), <jats:italic>Dipodomys spectabilis<\/jats:italic> (Banner-tailed kangaroo rat), <jats:italic>Perognathus flavus<\/jats:italic> (Silky pocket mouse), and <jats:italic>Chaetodipus hispidus<\/jats:italic> (Hispid pocket mouse).

Its high risk of recurrence or metastasis post-chemotherapy makes DC-based immunotherapy a promising strategy, offering targeted cancer destruction, low side effects, memory formation, and overcoming the immune evasive ability of cancers. However, the limited response to DCs pulsed with single antigens remains a significant challenge. To overcome this, we enhanced DC antigen presentation by pulsing with TAAs. Our study focused on enhancing DC-mediated immune response specificity and intensity by combinatorial pulsing of TAAs, selected for their prevalence in NSCLC. We selected four types of TAAs expressed in NSCLC and pulsed DCs with the optimal combination. Next, we administered TAAs-pulsed DCs into the LLC1 mouse model to evaluate their anti-tumor efficacy. Our results showed that TAAs-pulsed DCs significantly reduced tumor size and promoted apoptosis in tumor tissue. Moreover, TAAs-pulsed DCs significantly increased total T cells in the spleen compared to the unpulsed DCs. Additionally, in vitro stimulation of splenocytes from the TAAs-pulsed DCs showed notable T-cell proliferation and increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multiple TAA pulsing to enhance the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, thereby strengthening the immune response against tumors.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cancers"]},{"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198847892.003.0007","title":["States as Metaphysically Possible Worlds"],"author":[{"given":"Anna","family":"Mahtani","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter assesses whether the credence framework could accommodate the tenet (that credence claims are opaque) while retaining the assumption that states are metaphysically possible worlds.

Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV can help to prevent transmission of the virus to babies. However, many pregnant women are not aware of their HIV status or do not receive timely testing. This study was conducted to determine the knowledge of pregnant women with HIV\/AIDS attending ANC at healthcare centers in Tripoli.\nMethods\n A cross-sectional study was conducted in five healthcare centers for pregnant women attending ANC follow-up centers. The women were asked about their knowledge of HIV testing and mother-to-child transmission.\nResults\n This study showed that less than half of all pregnant women (47.9%) reported having been knowledgeable to be tested for HIV, which was a low percentage. The Internet was the primary source of information about HIV\/AIDS for 28.2% of the respondents. Almost all pregnant women (98.2%) said they knew about HIV\/AIDS. As well as (52.3%) understood how HIV\/AIDS could be transmitted from mother to child and the role of antiretroviral drugs. And 71.6% believed that the tests were effective at reducing transmission from mother to child.\nConclusion\n Pregnant women were found to have a low level of knowledge in this study. Knowledge must be transformed into action to make a difference. Therefore, health service organizations and other responsible bodies should implement activities that can promote behavioral change. Healthcare providers need to educate pregnant women about the importance of HIV testing and remove obstacles that prevent women from getting

Six hours of exposure to VA-ECMO also decreased left ventricular levels of cardiolipin and tafazzin in healthy swine compared with sham controls. To explore whether cardiolipin depletion by VA-ECMO increases infarct size, we performed left anterior descending artery occlusion for a total of 120 minutes followed by 180 minutes of reperfusion in adult swine in the presence and absence of MTP-131, an amphipathic molecule that interacts with cardiolipin to stabilize the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Its predominant mode of operation utilizes the polymerization of the scaffold protein clathrin forming a coat around the vesicle; therefore, it is termed clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Throughout evolution, the machinery that mediates CME is marked by losses, multiplications, and innovations. CME employs a limited number of conserved structural domains and folds, whose assembly and connections are species dependent. In plants, many of the domains are grouped into an ancient multimeric complex, the TPLATE complex, which occupies a central position as an interaction hub for the endocytic machinery. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding the structural aspects of plant CME, and we draw comparisons to other model systems.

Through the application of the triple difference model, the research examines the influence of CET policy on the green innovation endeavors of enterprises characterized by various life cycles. The research outcomes reveal the following: 1) CET policy significantly impacts the green innovation of mature enterprises, and contributes to the enrichment of the quality of their green innovation endeavors. 2) Due to limitations pertaining to financing constraints and business expansion, CET policy fails to foster green innovation within the growth and decline phases of enterprises. 3) Government subsidies can overturn the unfavorable position of growth-stage enterprises in carbon emissions trading and propel them towards heightened green innovation. However, government subsidies do not yield a substantial moderating effect on the green innovation endeavors of maturity-stage enterprises. Simultaneously, even if declining-phase enterprises are subjected to government subsidies, these subsidies do not reverse their innovation disadvantage in carbon emissions rights trading. In addition, we also found that in areas with heightened public awareness of environmental protection and state-owned enterprises, the positive regulatory effect of government subsidies is more significant.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to hypozincemia, resulting in further progression of CKD. In CKD, intestinal Zn absorption, the main regulator of systemic Zn metabolism, is often impaired; however, the mechanism underlying Zn malabsorption remains unclear. Here, we evaluated intestinal Zn absorption capacity in a rat model of CKD induced by 5\/6 nephrectomy (5\/6 Nx). Rats were given Zn and the incremental area under the plasma Zn concentration-time curve (iAUC) was measured, as well as expression of ZIP4, an intestinal Zn transporter. We found that 5\/6 Nx rats showed lower iAUC than sham-operated rats, but expression of ZIP4 protein was upregulated. We therefore focused on other Zn absorption regulators to explore the mechanism by which Zn absorption was substantially decreased. Because some phosphate compounds inhibit Zn absorption by co-precipitation and hyperphosphatemia is a common symptom in advanced CKD, we measured inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels. Pi was elevated not only in serum but also in the intestinal lumen of 5\/6 Nx rats. Furthermore, intestinal intraluminal Pi administration decreased the iAUC in a dose-dependent manner in normal rats. In vitro, increased Pi concentration decreased Zn solubility under physiological conditions. Furthermore, dietary Pi restriction ameliorated hypozincemia in 5\/6 Nx rats. We conclude that hyperphosphatemia or excess Pi intake is a factor in Zn malabsorption and hypozincemia in CKD.

Often, these storms occur simultaneously, resulting in compound events that intensify local impacts when they happen in the same location or spread impacts across the territory when they occur in different areas. These multivariate and spatially compound events present significant challenges for risk management, potentially overwhelming emergency services. In this study, we analysed the prevailing atmospheric conditions during various types of extreme episodes, aiming to create the first classification of synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) conducive to compound events involving heavy rainfall and storm waves in the Spanish NW Mediterranean. To achieve this, we developed a methodological framework that combines an objective synoptic classification method based on principal component analysis and k-means clustering with a Bayesian network. This methodology was applied to a dataset comprising 562 storm events recorded over 30\u00a0years, including 112 compound events. First, we used the framework to determine the optimal combination of domain size, classification variables, and number of clusters based on the synoptic skill to replicate local-scale values of daily rainfall and significant wave height. Subsequently, we identified SWPs associated with extreme compound events, which are often characterised by upper-level lows and trough structures in conjunction with Mediterranean cyclones, resulting in severe to extreme coastal storms combined with convective systems. The obtained classification demonstrated strong skill, with scores exceeding 0.4 when considering factors like seasonality or the North Atlantic Oscillation. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of compound terrestrial\u2013maritime extreme events in the study area and have the potential to aid in the development of effective risk management strategies.\n                    <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Hydrology and Earth System Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.59072\/rper.vi67.548","title":["O Papel do Marketing Digital na Perce\u00e7\u00e3o das Marcas Cidade \u2013 O caso de Castelo Branco"],"author":[{"given":"Susana","family":"Bernardino","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.","family":"Freitas Santos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Margarida","family":"M.

Berry pomace is an especially rich source of many bioactive compounds. Blackcurrant pomace is particularly valuable because of the large amount of extractable anthocyanins remaining in the fruit skin. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) parameters on the content of anthocyanins and color parameters of blackcurrant pomace extracts. The pomace used for the study was very rich in anthocyanins\u2014an average content of 853.2 mg\/100 g fresh weight. The effect of temperature (25, 35, 45 \u00b0C), time (15, 30, 60 min) and material\/solvent ratio (1:20 or 1:7) on extraction yield was analyzed. The extracts were obtained using two solvents: water\u2013ethanol acidified with HCl and water acidified with citric acid. Either solvent type, as well as the other parameters of the extraction process, have an impact on the level of anthocyanins in the extracts. The lowest range of extraction yield (63\u201368%) was obtained for a 1:7 ratio with water\u2013citric acid solvent. The highest range of extraction yield (74\u201393%) was obtained for a 1:7 ratio with water\u2013ethanol solvent. The most efficient method was extraction in a water\u2013ethanol solvent (50\/50 v\/v) acidified with HCl, at a 1:7 material\/solvent ratio, at 35 \u00b0C, for 15 min, providing 93% process efficiency. A strong relationship (r &gt; 0.991) was also found between anthocyanin content and color saturation (C*) or hue (h\u00b0) in the obtained extracts. Based on the E1% coloring strength results, all the extracts obtained can be considered strong colorants, especially those obtained with the water\u2013citric acid solvent.

The present work aims to take a significant leap forward by proposing a design process where sustainability serves as the primary driving force. In this context, sustainability is positioned as a fundamental component to be integrated into the initial stages of design, introducing innovative multidisciplinary criteria that redefine the design paradigm. Within this framework, sustainability is characterized using a comprehensive and quantifiable index encompassing technological, environmental, economic, and circular economy dimensions. To demonstrate the practical application of sustainability as the primary criterion in designing mechanical components, a parametrized finite element model of a composite plate is utilized, integrating both pristine and recycled fibers. Subsequently, a demonstrator derived from the aviation industry\u2014specifically, a hat stiffener\u2014is employed as a validation platform for the proposed methodology, ensuring alignment with the demonstrator\u2019s specific requirements. Various representative trade-off scenarios are implemented to guide engineers\u2019 decision-making during the conceptual design phase. Additionally, the robustness of the aforementioned methodology is thoroughly assessed concerning changes in the priority assigned to each sustainability criterion and its sensitivity to variations in the initial data. The significance of the proposed design methodology lies in its effectiveness in addressing the complex challenges presented by conflicting sustainability objectives.

Recent evidence suggests a role for thyroid hormone signaling, principally via 3,5,3',5'-Tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4), in the regulation of metamorphosis, programmed cell death and skeletogenesis in echinoids (sea urchins and sand dollars) and sea stars. Here we test whether TH signaling in skeletogenesis is a shared trait of Echinozoa (Echinoida and Holothouroida) and Asterozoa (Ophiourida and Asteroida). We demonstrate dramatic acceleration of skeletogenesis in three classes of echinoderms: sea urchins, sea stars, and brittle stars (echinoids, asteroids, and ophiuroids). Fluorescently labeled thyroid hormone analogues reveal thyroid hormone binding to cells proximal to regions of skeletogenesis in the gut and juvenile rudiment. Immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated MAPK in the presence and absence of TH binding inhibitors suggests that THs may act via phosphorylation of MAPK (ERK1\/2) to accelerate skeletogenesis in the three echinoderm groups. Additionally, we detect thyroid hormone binding to the cell membrane and nucleus during metamorphic development in echinoderms. Together, these results indicate that TH regulation of mesenchyme cell activity via integrin-mediated MAPK signaling may be a conserved mechanism for the regulation of skeletogenesis in echinoderm development. Additionally, TH action via a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor may regulate metamorphic development. Our findings shed light on potentially ancient pathways of thyroid hormone activity in echinoids, ophiuroids, and asteroids, or on a signaling system that has been repeatedly co-opted to coordinate metamorphic development in bilaterians.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.29327\/7346680","title":["O USO DO DESIGN THINKING NO DESENVOLVIMENTO DE A\u00c7\u00d5ES FORMATIVAS EM PRIMEIROS SOCORROS: UMA EXPERI\u00caNCIA COM PROFISSIONAIS DA EDUCA\u00c7\u00c3O B\u00c1SICA"],"author":[{"given":"Mariana Parreira","family":"Lopes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Let\u00edcia Rodrigues da","family":"Fonseca","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Os acidentes, enquanto eventos inesperados ou indesejados resultam em les\u00f5es, podendo ser evitados em diversos ambientes, inclusive no escolar, sendo que ap\u00f3s a sua ocorr\u00eanica demandam por a\u00e7\u00f5es imediatas no que tange a presta\u00e7\u00e3o de primeiros socorros.

Es a partir de estas interacciones que se inicia un proceso de subjetivaci\u00f3n (valorizaci\u00f3n y cualificaci\u00f3n) y des-subjetivaci\u00f3n social: un proceso que encuentra en el tejido urbano los prerrequisitos para la realizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica (individual y colectiva) y para el reconocimiento social de los seres humanos.

Automatic detection and early warning of forest fire in the early stage is very important for protecting forest resources and reducing disaster losses. Unmanned forest fire monitoring is one popular way of forest fire automatic detection. However, the actual forest environment is complex and diverse, and the vision image is affected by various factors easily such as geographical location, seasons, cloudy weather, day and night, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel fire detection method called Fire-PPYOLOE. We design a new backbone and neck structure leveraging large kernel convolution to capture a large arrange area of reception field based on the existing fast and accurate object detection model PP-YOLOE. In addition, our model maintains the high-speed performance of the single-stage detection model and reduces model parameters by using CSPNet significantly. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of Fire-PPYOLOE from the views of detection accuracy and speed. The results show that our Fire-PPYOLOE is able to detect the smoke- and flame-like objects because it can learn features around the object to be detected. It can provide real-time forest fire prevention and early detection.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Sensors"]},{"DOI":"10.3847\/1538-4365\/ad0ceb","title":["The Distribution of Semidetached Binaries.

Large-scale time-domain surveys provide many light curves of binary systems, while Gaia offers high-precision astrometric data. In this paper, we develop, validate, and apply a pipeline that combines the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with a forward model and DBSCAN clustering to search for semidetached binaries and estimate the inclination, relative radius, mass ratio, and temperature ratio of each using light curves. We train our model on the mock light curves from Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE), which provides broad coverage of light-curve simulations for semidetached binaries.

Utilizing the distance from Gaia, we determine their masses and radii with median fractional uncertainties of \u223c26% and \u223c7%, respectively.

Because weather factors are co-incidental and partly correlated, we have used geography to separate out the impact of individual weather parameters on other seasonal variables using campylobacteriosis as a case study. Campylobacter infections are found worldwide and are the most common bacterial food-borne disease in developed countries, where they exhibit consistent but country specific seasonality. We developed a novel conditional incidence method, based on classical stratification, exploiting the long term, high-resolution, linkage of approximately one-million campylobacteriosis cases over 20 years in England and Wales with local meteorological datasets from diagnostic laboratory locations. The predicted incidence of campylobacteriosis increased by 1 case per million people for every 5\u00b0 (Celsius) increase in temperature within the range of 8\u00b0\u201315\u00b0. Limited association was observed outside that range. There were strong associations with day-length. Cases tended to increase with relative humidity in the region of 75\u201380%, while the associations with rainfall and wind-speed were weaker.<\/jats:p>\n<jats:p>The approach is able to examine multiple factors and model how complex trends arise, <jats:italic>e.g<\/jats:italic>. the consistent steep increase in campylobacteriosis in England and Wales in May-June and its spatial variability.

A key output of the analysis is a thoroughly phenomenological description of the incidence of the disease conditional on specific local weather factors. The study can be crucially important to infer the elusive mechanism of transmission of campylobacteriosis; for instance, by simulating the conditional incidence for a postulated mechanism and compare it with the phenomenological patterns as benchmark. The findings challenge the assumption, commonly made in statistical models, that the transformed mean rate of infection for diseases like campylobacteriosis is a mere additive and combination of the environmental variables.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["PLOS Computational Biology"]},{"DOI":"10.1090\/jams\/1044","title":["No infinite spin for planar total collision"],"author":[{"given":"Richard","family":"Moeckel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Richard","family":"Montgomery","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<p>The infinite spin problem is an old problem concerning the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the <italic>n<\/italic>-body problem.

It is broader than assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) and includes any form of human reproduction that relies on medical resources. MR is, very often, a lifestyle procedure that is given to meet a reproductive project. Its purpose is not necessarily to address, cure, or treat infertility but to provide options in reproduction for both infertile and fertile. MR is thus poised for environmental evaluation not only as a procedure which increases population and uses resources, but also as a healthcare offering with clinically unnecessary carbon expenditure, and a reproductive choice in a time of climate change. The book offers an applied ethics at the nexus of environmental ethics, medical ethics, and sexual ethics. The introduction situates the modern advent of MR within climate change ethics. Part I details the numerous natural resources used by medical reproduction in all its forms, emphasizing the aspects that are used by fertile people to demonstrate that it is a voluntary lifestyle choice. Part II offers policy suggestions for sustainable MR, with a particular sensitivity to the desires that some people have to be parents and the global claim for medical and climate justice.

A cross-sectional research design was adopted using mixed methods of data collection from 177 households between May and June 2017. Results reveal that most families under CCT devote the largest portion of household health expenditure for inpatient health seeking. About 40% of the total expenditure is covered by the National Health Insurance Program and the cost for hospitalisation mostly comes from the out-of-pocket source. Moreover, the common problems encountered during health utilisation and spending are poor customer service of healthcare facilities and uncompensated hospital bill by health insurance. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Health Management"]},{"DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-psych-012723-100945","title":["Beyond the Tricks: The Science and Comparative Cognition of Magic"],"author":[{"given":"Elias","family":"Garcia-Pelegrin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore, Singapore;"}]},{"given":"Alexandra K.","family":"Schnell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"}]},{"given":"Clive","family":"Wilkins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"}]},{"given":"Nicola S.","family":"Clayton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Magic is an art form that has fascinated humans for centuries.

For time-to-event outcomes, this prediction is typically based on a regression model. The Cox proportional hazard (PH) model represents one of the most popular regression models for analysing time-to-event data. However, several flexible models that go beyond the assumption of proportionality of hazards have been recently developed. These include flexible hazard-based models using splines or models based on more general hazard structures. In these 2 types of models, non-linear associations and time-varying regression coefficient(s) can be easily included. Assessing the predictive ability of a hazard-based regression model is necessary to validate a predictive model but it might prove difficult for models other than the Cox PH model. We present a tutorial which explains how the predictive ability of hazard-based regression models can be assessed, focusing on the 3 commonly used performance measures. We report (i) the overall prediction ability using prediction error curve and the Brier score, (ii) the discriminative ability using the cumulative\/dynamic area under the receiving operator characteristic curve, and (iii) the calibration ability, i.e., the agreement between observed and predicted probabilities, using calibration plots and graphical comparison between predicted and observed survival.

NextDextTM, a specific long-chain dextran with a high degree of polymerisation, produced using Weissella cibaria, was recently shown to exert prebiotic potential in vitro. In this study, the ex vivo SIFR\u00ae technology, recently validated to provide predictive insights into gut microbiome modulation down to the species level, was used to investigate the effects of this long-chain dextran on the gut microbiota of six human adults that altogether covered different enterotypes. A novel community modulation score (CMS) was introduced based on the strength of quantitative 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the highly controlled ex vivo conditions. This CMS overcomes the limitations of traditional \u03b1-diversity indices and its application in the current study revealed that dextran is a potent booster of microbial diversity compared to the reference prebiotic inulin (IN). Long-chain dextran not only exerted bifidogenic effects but also consistently promoted Bacteroides spp., Parabacteroides distasonis and butyrate-producing species like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Anaerobutyricum hallii. Further, long-chain dextran treatment resulted in lower gas production compared to IN, suggesting that long-chain dextran could be better tolerated. The additional increase in Bacteroides for dextran compared to IN is likely related to the higher propionate:acetate ratio, attributing potential to long-chain dextran for improving metabolic health and weight management. Moreover, the stimulation of butyrate by dextran suggests its potential for improving gut barrier function and inflammation. Overall, this study provides a novel tool for assessing gut microbial diversity ex vivo and positions long-chain dextran as a substrate that has unique microbial diversity enhancing properties.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biology"]},{"DOI":"10.1364\/optica.502020","title":["Non-diffracting polarization features around far-field zeros of electromagnetic radiation"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3741-4202","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Alex J.","family":"Vernon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0220mzb33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2598-4611","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Andrew","family":"Kille","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The George Washington University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4555-1186","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Francisco J.","family":"Rodr\u00edguez-Fortu\u00f1o","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/0220mzb33","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0679-3307","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Andrei","family":"Afanasev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The George Washington University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Light from any physical source diffracts over space, as spherical wavefronts grow and energy density is spread out.

In this comparative analysis-based study, three voltage stability assessment indices\u2014VSA_A, VSA_B, and VSA_W\u2014and a loss minimization condition (LMC)-based framework are used in the initial stage to achieve optimal distributed generation (DG)-based asset optimization for siting, followed by sizing. The respective techniques are evaluated across two variants of multiple load growth horizons spread across 10 years. The suggested TESP technique is tested on two variants of a mesh-configured microgrid (MCMG) with varied load growth scenarios. One variant considers a 65-bus MG with a fixed load growth of 2.7% across two load growth horizons. The other variant considers a 75-bus MG with varied load growth across four load growth horizons, encapsulating an expansion-based planning perspective. The numerical results of the suggested TESP approach in a comparative study demonstrate its effectiveness, and it can be used by researchers and planning engineers as a planning framework for interconnected distribution tools across multiple planning horizons. The proposed study would contribute to enhancing the robustness and interconnectivity of smart grid distribution systems.

In light of the complications associated with pain relief medications, nonpharmacological and complementary medicine approaches have gained attention. This study aims to compare the effects of acupressure and music on venipuncture pain intensity in children. This randomized controlled clinical trial involved 180 children aged 3\u20136\u2009years who sought treatment at the Children\u2019s Medical Center Hospital Emergency Department at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The children were randomly assigned to one of three groups: acupressure, music, or control. The interventions were given within 5\u2009minutes, starting 3\u2009minutes before the venipuncture and continuing until completion. The interventions included playing music through headphones and applying acupressure to the Hugo point. Venipuncture was carried out under identical conditions using an Angiocath 24G needle. Pain intensity was assessed using the Oucher scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS 24, employing the Kruskal\u2013Wallis, chi-square, and Bonferroni pairwise comparison tests, with a significance level of 0.05. The mean pain intensity was 3.32\u2009\u00b1\u20091.44 in the music group, 4.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.51 in the acupressure group, and 8.32\u2009\u00b1\u20091.10 in the control group.

To improve the safety assessment of existing subsea tunnels, a coupled hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (H-M-C) model is proposed to simulate the chloride ions migration process with hydrostatic pressure in the RC lining of subsea tunnels for obtaining the long-term distribution of chloride ions in the RC lining more accurately. In the H-M-C coupled model, the volume fluid fraction and convection velocity obtained from the bidirectionally coupled hydraulic and mechanic analysis are unidirectionally considered in the analysis of convection, diffusion, and adsorption of chloride ions in the RC lining. In addition, to consider the influence of concrete microscopic pores (e.g., gel pores and capillary pores) size on chloride ion migration, the classic expression of the effective diffusion coefficient is modified by considering a constrictivity factor that varies nonlinearly with the microscopic pore size. Results indicate that in the diffusion zone, the concentration of chloride ions significantly increases with increasing gel\/capillary pores radius (<jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>peak<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sup>), leading to a rapid non-linear decrease in the service time of the RC subsea tunnel. Afterward, to more clearly ascertain the sensitivity of the effects of constrictivity of gel\/capillary pores in concrete on chloride ion migration, the sensitivity analyses are carried out on four sets of parameters (i.e., saturated permeability, van Genuchten parameters, initial saturation, and binding capacity parameters). The results of the sensitivity analyses suggest that the effects of capillary pores radius (<jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>peak<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sup>) on the penetration process of chloride ions in the concrete lining of subsea tunnels are more sensitive to the initial saturation (<jats:italic>S<\/jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>e<\/jats:italic><\/jats:sub>) than the vG parameters (<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>m<\/jats:italic>).

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative modality particularly in the setting of poor risk genetics and\/or persistent minimal residual disease. Limited studies have directly explored the impact of patient- and transplant-related factors on post-transplant outcomes in T-ALL.\nMethods\n Using a large dataset from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry, we identified 1907 adult T-ALL patients (70% male) who underwent their first allo-HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) from matched sibling donors (MSD; 45%), unrelated donors (UD; 43%) or haploidentical donors (12%) between 2010 and 2021.\nResults\n The median age at transplant was 33.4 years (18.1\u201375). The median follow up was 2.9 years. Most patients underwent total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative conditioning (69%). The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 69.4%, and leukemia -free survival (LFS) was 62.1%. In multivariate analysis, advanced age at transplant negatively affected LFS (for each 10-year increment, HR\u2009=\u20091.11, p\u2009=\u20090.004), GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (HR\u2009=\u20091.06, p\u2009=\u20090.04), OS (HR\u2009=\u20091.12, p\u2009=\u20090.002), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR\u2009=\u20091.23, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). A later year of HSCT was associated with improved GFRS (For each 3-year increment, HR\u2009=\u20090.89, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.02), and decreased NRM (HR\u2009=\u20090.82, p\u2009=\u20090.008).

Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD), also known as allergic inflammatory skin disease, is a common condition. Currently, the house dust mite animal model is used in the research of cAD; however, this model exhibits significant individual variation and is difficult to standardize. In this study, we used ovalbumin as an antigen to sensitize and stimulate dogs, thereby establishing a stable model mimicking the T-helper 2 (Th2) response seen in cAD. Our objective was to create a cAD model that could be employed to evaluate the efficacy of novel drugs and mimic the Th2 dominant allergic response observed in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis of dogs.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In this study, six beagles were used.

We matched 16 PCVT patients with 64 pregnant and puerperal women without PCVT to explore risk factors and clinical susceptibility to PCVT.\nResults\n PCVT occurred commonly during the first trimester (43.75%) and the puerperium (37.5%). The frequency of anemia, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, dehydration, and pre-pregnancy anemia was significantly higher in women with PCVT than in those without PCVT (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>&lt;0.05). Among the 16 patients, five were diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome and one were diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Three patients had distinct protein S deficiency and one had protein C deficiency. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed for five patients and revealed likely pathogenic mutations associated with CVT, including heterozygous PROC c.1218G\u2009&gt;\u2009A (p. Met406Ile), heterozygous PROS1 c.301C\u2009&gt;\u2009T (p. Arg101Cys), composite heterozygous mutation in the F8 gene (c.144-1259C\u2009&gt;\u2009T; c.6724G\u2009&gt;\u2009A (p.

For confirmed PCVT patients, autoimmune diseases, hereditary thrombophilia, and hematological disorders were common causes. Screening for potential etiologies should be paid more attention, as it has implications for treatment and long-term management.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.37539\/231024.2023.99.41.023","title":["STUDY OF EMOTIONAL STABILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF TERRORIST INFORMATION"],"author":[{"given":"Valentina Ivanovna","family":"Dolgova","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elena Germanovna","family":"Kapitanets","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Olga Alexandrovna","family":"Kondratyeva","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Konstantin Anatolievich","family":"Laptev","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gulmira Kazbekovna","family":"Mukasheva","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The relevance of the topic is caused by growing terrorist information.

A specialized Halitosis Associated Life-quality Test (HALT) questionnaire was used to assess QOL of these patients. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between HALT score and age. We found that 21 (23.86%) patients were male and 67 (76.14%) patients were female. HALT scores in females were significantly higher than in males (57.6 \u00b1 13.6 vs. 45.5 \u00b1 11.9, P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, 13 of the 20 items of the HALT questionnaire showed significant differences between the sexes. No correlation was identified between HALT score and age.

One of the important topics in the simulation of dam break caused by non-Newtonian fluid flow is the modeling of frictional stresses. In this research, after collecting several relationships to model the coefficient of friction loss of non-Newtonian fluid, a two-dimensional model was developed based on the numerical solution of shallow water equations in curvilinear coordinates to simulate hyperconcentrated flow. The results of the validation of the model were presented by comparing the measurement data of the suddenly complete dam break caused by the non-Newtonian fluid flow in the form of graphs, which all emphasize the accuracy of the developed model. It was also shown that for a suddenly complete dam break, with an increase in fluid volume concentration from 13.8 to 36.4%, the flow depth at the failure site increases by 18.8%. Next, asymmetric two-dimensional partial dam break of non-Newtonian fluid was simulated and compared with the results of Newtonian fluid. The results showed that the maximum flow velocity in the center of the fracture wall for the non-Newtonian fluid with a concentration of 32.2% is less than half of the maximum velocity of the Newtonian fluid.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Applied Water Science"]},{"DOI":"10.22541\/essoar.170561648.85020611\/v1","title":["Carbon stocks and fluxes from a boreal conifer swamp: filling a knowledge gap for modelling the boreal C cycle"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8327-2121","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Scott J.","family":"Davidson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Plymouth"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1564-010X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marissa A","family":"Davies","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Waterloo"}]},{"given":"Emma","family":"Wegener","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Waterloo"}]},{"given":"Sara","family":"Claussen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Waterloo"}]},{"given":"Megan","family":"Schmidt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Waterloo"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3086-2854","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Michael","family":"Peacock","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8996-7271","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Maria","family":"Strack","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Waterloo"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p id=\"p1\">The carbon (C) dynamics of boreal coniferous swamps are a largely\nunderstudied component of wetland carbon cycling.

Good agreement is observed for moderate Prandtl numbers. However, for sufficiently high Prandtl numbers, deviations become notable. The reasons for the deviations according to their relevance are (i) monotonically decreasing temperature profile inherent to the AT, whereas the fully resolved numerical solutions exhibit a local maximum in the temperature profile away from the plate; and (ii) inapplicability of the concept of dividing the flow field into a region affected and a region unaffected by heat transfer according to the thermal boundary layer thickness. This concept leads to the overestimation of the temperature close to the wall and to the existence of a threshold Prandtl number, for which the thermal boundary layer thickness does not meet the free surface anymore. Around this threshold Prandtl number, the temperature field shows a discontinuous behaviour.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Fluid Mechanics"]},{"DOI":"10.2460\/javma.23.10.0587","title":["Small animal veterinary clients prefer veterinarians to decide when to terminate resuscitation and to be informed after cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts"],"author":[{"given":"Leonie","family":"Bertram","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL"}]},{"given":"Kendon","family":"Kuo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL"}]},{"given":"Erik","family":"Hofmeister","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL"}]},{"given":"Katherine","family":"Gerken","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>OBJECTIVE<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>To identify the preferences of small animal veterinary clients for the timing of communication during CPR and whether these clients prefer the veterinarian or pet owner to decide on the termination of resuscitation.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>SAMPLE<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Surveys (n = 1,648) were completed between January 20 and February 3, 2023, by clients of the Wilford and Kate Bailey Small Animal Teaching Hospital.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>METHODS<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>This cross-sectional observational study used an anonymous internet-based survey distributed to 28,000 clients of an academic small animal veterinary hospital.

The materials with higher cross-link density show higher thermal properties, mechanical properties and shape fixation ratio.

Therefore, we propose a unique and practical approach based on a multiple attention-guided fusion mechanism and ensemble learning network (MAFE-Net) for retinal vessel segmentation. In conventional UNet-based models, long-distance dependencies are explicitly modeled, which may cause partial scene information loss. To compensate for the deficiency, various blood vessel features can be extracted from retinal images by using an attention-guided fusion module. In the skip connection part, a unique spatial attention module is applied to remove redundant and irrelevant information; this structure helps to better integrate low-level and high-level features. The final step involves a DropOut layer that removes some neurons randomly to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Moreover, an ensemble learning framework is designed to detect retinal vessels by combining different deep learning models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experimental results were verified in public datasets STARE, DRIVE, and CHASEDB1, which achieved F1 scores of 0.842, 0.825, and 0.814, and Accuracy values of 0.975, 0.969, and 0.975, respectively.

The fabricated photonic NEMS photodiode was characterized by different photo-electrical (I-V, I-t) and frequency\/time dependent and illuminated capacitance (C-V\/f, C-t, C-V\/ill.) and conductance-voltage (G-V) measurements under different frequencies and artificial light intensity power conditions. The I-V tests showed an excellent current rectifying ability and very well net photocurrent generation features of the photodiode. The specific detectivity of the photodiode was found as high as almost approaching 1011 Jones. The SCLC (space charge limited current conduction) analyses made on the double-log I-V plots of the photodiode revealed that the trap-filling TFL-SCLC and trap-free SCLC current conduction mechanisms are the two prevailing conduction mechanisms in the forward bias voltage region.

The qualitative study assesses the impact of COVID-19-related changes and their effects on students\u2019 clinical learning from student and faculty perspectives. Methods. This qualitative study involved third- and fourth-year predoctoral dental students and full-time dental clinical faculty. A semistructured interview guide was used. The interview guide consisted of seven open-ended questions about the impact of the new COVID-19-related infection control procedures on students\u2019 learning experience in the dental clinic. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a basic interpretative approach by two independent researchers. Emerged themes were identified. Results. Twelve faculty members and 21 students participated in six focus groups. Three major themes emerged from the analysis: learning challenges, learning opportunities, and long-term impact. Students identified four categories of learning challenges: communication, visualization, clinical exposure, and heat. Five learning challenges identified by faculty were: faculty burnout, service delivery challenges, material wastage, teaching difficulties, and lack of comprehensive care. The five learning opportunities students identified were autonomy, preparedness, efficiency, safety, and personalized feedback. Learning opportunities identified by faculty were time management, autonomy, and preparedness. Three categories of long-term impact on students identified were future opportunities, adaptation, and postgraduation plans. Faculty identified apathy, career re-evaluation, and adaption as the long-term impact of COVID-19-related changes. Conclusion. Although the new COVID-19-related infection control procedures and regulations in the dental school clinical setting come with learning challenges, students and faculty also saw learning opportunities through increased autonomy, preparedness, and efficiency.

This article endeavors to investigate the predictive factors of SSIs following surgical interventions that involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within a single institution in a resource-limited setting. Methods Over seven years from June 2015 to June 2022, patients who underwent GI surgery and developed SSI were retrospectively matched with an unaffected case-control cohort of patients. Standardized techniques for wound culture, laboratory evaluation of bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were employed. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the predictive factors associated with 30-day postoperative SSI occurrence. Results A total of 525 patients who underwent GI surgical procedures were included, among whom, 86 (16.4%) developed SSI and the majority of SSIs were superficial (74.4%). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacterium (54.4%), and a high percentage of multidrug-resistant organisms were observed (63.8%). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, illiteracy (Odds ratio [OR]:40.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.54-170.26), smoking (OR: 21.15; 95% CI: 4.63-96.67), diabetes (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 2.27-11.35), leukocytosis (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24-5.53), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.35-10.16), contaminated and dirty wounds (OR: 6.51; 95% CI:1.62-26.09), longer operation duration (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), emergency operations (OR: 12.58; 95% CI: 2.91-54.30), and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.28-7.10) were the independent risk factors for SSI (all p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Conclusions This study highlights significant predictors of SSI, including illiteracy, smoking, diabetes, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, contaminated and dirty wounds, longer operative time, emergency operations, and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Identifying these risk factors can help surgeons adopt appropriate measures to reduce postoperative SSI and improve the quality of surgical care, especially in a resource-limited setting with no obvious and strict policy for reducing SSI.<\/ns5:p>","container-title":["F1000Research"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/s24020618","title":["Robot Grasp Planning: A Learning from Demonstration-Based Approach"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5955-9755","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kaimeng","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"FANUC Advanced Research Laboratory, FANUC America Corporation, Union City, CA 94587, USA"}]},{"given":"Yongxiang","family":"Fan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"FANUC Advanced Research Laboratory, FANUC America Corporation, Union City, CA 94587, USA"}]},{"given":"Ichiro","family":"Sakuma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Robot grasping constitutes an essential capability in fulfilling the complexities of advanced industrial operations. This field has been extensively investigated to address a range of practical applications. However, the generation of a stable grasp remains challenging, principally due to the constraints imposed by object geometries and the diverse objectives of the tasks. In this work, we propose a novel learning from demonstration-based grasp-planning framework. This framework is designed to extract crucial human grasp skills, namely the contact region and approach direction, from a single demonstration. Then, it formulates an optimization problem that integrates the extracted skills to generate a stable grasp. Distinct from conventional methods that rely on learning implicit synergies through human demonstration or on mapping the dissimilar kinematics between human hands and robot grippers, our approach focuses on learning the intuitive human intent that involves the potential contact regions and the grasping approach direction. Furthermore, our optimization formulation is capable of identifying the optimal grasp by minimizing the surface fitting error between the demonstrated contact regions on the object and the gripper finger surface and imposing a penalty for any misalignment between the demonstrated and the gripper\u2019s approach directions.

First, the RGB image was converted into the HSV space, and a mixed Gaussian background model was established. Next, the object area was obtained through background subtraction, residual interference in the foreground was removed using the median filtering method, and morphological processing was performed. Then, an improved Canny algorithm using an automatic threshold from the Otsu method was used to extract the overall object contour. Finally, feature fusion of edge contours and the foreground area was performed to obtain the final object contour.

There are concepts which need to be rethought, moves which turn out to be invalid, and principles which need to be rejected or transformed. The central aim is to give those who use the credence framework an awareness of the insight and its wide-reaching implications. The credence framework is used throughout the sciences and social sciences. On this framework, credences (degrees of belief, subjective probabilities, or Bayesian probabilities) are assigned to certain objects\u2014but what objects? I argue that the objects of credence are \u2018opaque\u2019 or \u2018hyperintensional\u2019: to adapt an example from Gottlob Frege, a person\u2019s credence that Hesperus is bright might be different from their credence that Phosphorus is bright, if that person does not know that Hesperus and Phosphorus are one and the same. We might put the point by saying that our credences are not about objects in themselves, but about objects under designators. This point has far-reaching implications for users of the credence framework. There are implications for principles of rationality, including deference principles and the Principal Principle, and practical implications for decision theory and welfare economics. Furthermore, there are implications for how the framework should be interpreted: this book explores both two-dimensionalism and impossible worlds, and assimilating either into the credence framework brings further significant repercussions.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.56048\/mqr20225.8.1.2024.410-423","title":["Prevalencia del personal de salud que estuvo involucrado o trataron a pacientes con diagn\u00f3stico de COVID 19 en \u00e1reas cr\u00edticas del Hospital Jos\u00e9 Carrasco Arteaga en el a\u00f1o 2022"],"author":[{"given":"Diana Estefan\u00eda","family":"Peralta-Sumba","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gerardo Eugenio","family":"Campoverde-Jim\u00e9nez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Introducci\u00f3n: La pandemia de COVID-19 ha ejercido una presi\u00f3n extrema sobre los sistemas de salud a nivel mundial, impactando significativamente en la salud mental de los profesionales de la salud involucrados en el tratamiento de pacientes afectados.&#x0D;\nEste estudio se enfoc\u00f3 en evaluar la prevalencia de ansiedad y depresi\u00f3n entre el personal m\u00e9dico y de enfermer\u00eda que estuvo en primera l\u00ednea atendiendo a pacientes con COVID-19 en \u00e1reas cr\u00edticas del Hospital Jos\u00e9 Carrasco Arteaga durante el a\u00f1o 2022.&#x0D;\nMetodolog\u00eda: Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio descriptivo observacional de corte transversal, tomando una muestra aleatoria de 78 personas, entre auxiliares de servicios, choferes, licenciadas de enfermer\u00eda, m\u00e9dicos y param\u00e9dicos.

One such technique combines epitaxial diamond growth and electron or ion irradiation (He, C, etc.), where NVs are activated by vacancy trapping at the nitrogen donor atoms upon thermal diffusion. In this work we study the efficiency of such method by analyzing NV depth profiles created by 340keV and also 4keV He irradiation in high purity CVD and HPHT diamond crystals and subjected to sequent annealing at 950\u25e6C and 1200\u25e6C temperatures. This analysis is coupled with the measurement of NV density in the bulk of CVD diamonds with nitrogen doping at low-ppb and low-ppm levels, exposed to MeV electrons in a wide range of the doses. For data analysis we developed an atomistic model based on probabilistic atomic jumps in a crystal lattice, which considers competitive trapping between di-(V<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>) or multi-vacancy defects compared to that of NVs. The efficiency of NV formation was defined as a ratio of the corresponding capture cross sections: \u03c3<jats:sub>NV<\/jats:sub> vs. \u03c3<jats:sub>V<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\n                  <\/jats:sub>.

Our research study was aiming to investigate the In-Silico and In-Vitro effect of chitosan nanoparticles on the growth hormones of Astragalus spp during callus and micropropagation of shoots and roots stages. The plant tissue culture technique allows for the laboratory reproduction of complete plants, organs, tissues, or cells under controlled laboratory conditions. The addition of phytohormones (natural or synthetic growth regulators) at appropriate stages of development or maturity can then be utilised to influence plant development. Callus induction methods, as well as shoot and root micropropagation protocols, were established on <jats:italic>Astragalus trigonus<\/jats:italic> seeds. Molecular docking illustrated that chitosan NPS showed an energy binding of -7.86 kcal\/ mol against ERF-1 target site. Chitosan formed seven hydrogen bonds with Glu5, Gln282, Asn9, Lys16, Glu324 and Glu390 with bond lengths of 2.05, 1.95, 2.05, 2.02, 2.01, 1.90 and 1.84 \u00c5. Among the various ratios and mixes of four growth regulators, a mixture of iso-pentenyl adenosine (IPA) and isopentenyladenine (2ip) with concentrations of 0.5mg\/L from each resulted in the highest Mean number of shoots (MNS) (17.5%) and Mean shoots length (MSL) (12.5cm) (1.28%). The best mixture was 0.5 IPA plus 0.5mg\/L 2ip, which was evaluated on five plant samples; MNS obtained a maximum value of 22.5 within two subcultures, second and third, then 18.8 with the first subculture, 15.8 with the fourth subculture, and 13.8 with the fifth subculture. Also, MLS improved in all five subcultures, although the highest value was 15cm with the second subculture and 13.8cm with the fourth subculture. Auxins such as 1-Naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA) and In-dole-3-butyric acid (IBA) were applied to plant samples, with the maximum rooting reaching 100% and the root length improving to 14.4cm in comparison to the control, where rooting and root length were 74% and 12.6cm, respectively. Ionic gelatination was used to create chitosan nanoparticles in this study. These nanoparticles had an average particle size of roughly 6010 nm and a qua-si-spherical shape. Furthermore, the colloidal stability and surface characteristics of the as-prepared nanoparticles were studied using FT-IR and dynamic light scattering techniques. Chitosan NPs were used in various concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4mg\/L), The best concentration was 0.5mg\/L stimulating rooting with 83.3%, 4.7 root\/shoot number and root length 6.4cm.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.4312\/as.2024.12.1.115-139","title":["Newly Excavated Confucian Bamboo Manuscripts and Related Research"],"author":[{"given":"Sixin","family":"DING","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qiannan","family":"ZHAO","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The primary purpose of this article is to comprehensively survey the research on excavated Confucian texts from the past 30 years.

Despite growing awareness, challenges persist with accurate pain measurement, limiting research and clinical efforts. One method to assess pain perception is the Pain-Pressure Threshold (PPT), indicating the pressure at which pain is reported. Anxiety, comprising state and trait anxiety, has been suggested as a potential influencer of PPT, yet its precise impact remains uncertain. State anxiety is defined as a \"transient state of arousal subjectively experienced as anxiety\" Trait anxiety is \u201can individual's tendency to appraise situations as threatening, avoid anxiety-provoking situations, and demonstrate high baseline physiological arousal\u201d\n<jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\nThirty-eight participants with no history of persistent pain or anxiety completed data collection, 19 men and 19 women, ages 22-32. Subjects completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-5 (STAI-5) and underwent PPT testing at the upper trapezius and forearm extensors bilaterally, with results averaged to provide an extrapolation of global pressure tolerance. The same data was collected again 21 days later.\n<jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\nNo correlation existed between anxiety and PPT. No significant correlation (p=.148) was observed in State anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up, while trait anxiety displayed a moderate relationship (r=.612, p&lt;.001) between the initial and subsequent tests. These findings support the notion that state anxiety is more variable, contrasting with the presumed stability of trait anxiety. Pain-pressure threshold test-retest data revealed a moderate relationship (r=.542, p&lt;.001), consistent with prior research on PPT test reliability.\n<jats:bold>Discussion\/Conclusion:<\/jats:bold>\nThis research is unique in that we assessed the relationship between anxiety and PPT in young, healthy participants. The principal finding is that pain-pressure thresholds were not shown to be influenced by either trait or state anxiety in our sample. The data also provided further information about the test-retest consistency of the STAI-5 and PPT measures. This research provides initial baseline data, against which findings in other populations can be compared. Future research should continue to aim to quantify psychosocial factors and their influence on pain experiences.\n<jats:bold>Trial Registration: <\/jats:bold>This study was registered on 21\/09\/2023 on ClinicalTrials.gov: # NCT06047704<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.37539\/231024.2023.16.82.076","title":["THE PRACTICE OF STRUCTURING INFORMATION ABOUT ANIMALS IN THE FORM OF A DATABASE AND ITS APPLICATION OPTIONS"],"author":[{"given":"Irina Yurievna","family":"Eremina","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>An example of the software implementation of the information system - database \"Selection and genetic characteristics of dairy cattle of the Krasnoyarsk Territory by erythrocyte antigens\" in MS Access is described.

The primary objective of this study was to examine the impact of liquiritigenin on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice and the underlying mechanisms.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The anti-pulmonary fibrosis and anti-oxidant effects of liquiritigenin in vivo were tested by HE staining, Masson staining, DHE staining and bio-chemical methods. In vitro, primary mouse lung fibroblasts were treated with TGF-\u03b21 with or without liquiritigenin, the effects of liquiritigenin in inhibiting differentiation of myofibroblasts and facilitating the translocation of Nrf2 were valued using Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), western blotting and immunofluorescence. Nrf2 siRNA and SIRT1 siRNA were used to investigate the mechanism underlies liquiritigenin\u2019s effect in inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Liquiritigenin displayed a dose-dependent reduction effect in bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In laboratory experiments, it was evident that liquiritigenin possessed the ability to enhance and activate sirtuin1 (SIRT1), thereby facilitating the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and mitigating the oxidative stress-induced differentiation of primary mouse myofibroblasts. Moreover, our investigation unveiled that SIRT1 not only regulated myofibroblast differentiation via Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses against oxidative stress but also revealed liquiritigenin's activation of SIRT1, enabling direct binding to Smad. This led to decreased phosphorylation of the Smad complex, constrained nuclear translocation, and suppressed acetylation of the Smad complex, ultimately curtailing the transcription of fibrotic factors. Validation in live subjects provided substantial evidence for the anti-fibrotic efficacy of liquiritigenin through the SIRT1\/Nrf2 signaling pathway.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n

recommendations about physical activity (PA), due to this subject playing an important role in the phases of intention development and in preparation for it. Thus, the knowledge of future educators in the fields of health and PA is of vital importance when improving the levels of the latter in students. The objective of this research is to determine what knowledge future teachers have about health and PA, examining possible disparities according to the gender, age, and level of physical exercise of the participants. In addition, the psychometric properties of the instrument used were explored. A total of 321 Colombian university students from the Faculty of Education between the ages of sixteen and thirty-five participated in this study, providing sociodemographic information by filling out the CUAFYS-A questionnaire. Significant differences were found in the scale items according to sex and self-perception of being physically active. Also, the findings revealed a single-factor structure with nine items that had satisfactory reliability (\u03b1 = 0.71; CR = 0.72) and excellent goodness-of-fit indices (RMSEA = 0.055 (90% CI (0.3, 0.8), RMSR = 0.02, CFI = 0.935, NNFI = 0.912, CMIN\/DF = 1.97). Therefore, strategies and campaigns to promote PA knowledge in prospective teachers should be tailored according to gender and PA levels. Similarly, the CUAFYS-A questionnaire can be considered a valid and reliable instrument to identify the PA knowledge of future educators.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Healthcare"]},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s12905-024-02881-y","title":["An immune-related exosome signature predicts the prognosis and immunotherapy response in ovarian cancer"],"author":[{"given":"Kaibo","family":"Zhu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jiao","family":"Ma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yiping","family":"Tian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qin","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jun","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Cancer-derived exosomes contribute significantly in intracellular communication, particularly during tumorigenesis.

Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted to investigate the mechanisms and biological effects of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subtypes. Besides, an IOCE-related prognostic model of OC was constructed by Lasso regression analysis, and the signature was validated using GSE140082 as the validation set.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>In total, we obtained 21 differentially expressed IOCEs in OC, and identified two IOCE-associated subgroups by consensus clustering. IOCE-low subgroup showed a favorable prognosis while IOCE-high subgroup had a higher level of immune cell infiltration and immune response. GSEA showed that pathways in cancer and immune response were mainly enriched in IOCE-high subgroup. Thus, IOCE-high subgroup may benefit more in immunotherapy treatment. In addition, we constructed a risk model based on nine IOCE-associated genes (CLDN4, AKT2, CSPG5, ALDOC, LTA4H, PSMA2, PSMA5, TCIRG1, ANO6).<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We developed a novel stratification system for OV based on IOCE signature, which could be used to estimate the prognosis as well as immunotherapy for OC patient.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["BMC Women's Health"]},{"DOI":"10.37394\/23208.2024.21.3","title":["Dynamics of the Secretory Activity of the Female Moose Mammary Gland During the First Lactation at the Sumarokovskaya Moose Farm"],"author":[{"given":"L.

The mammary gland is an organ of dense consistency, consisting of four grouped hills divided into left and right halves, in which, in turn, the anterior and posterior lobes are distinguished, consisting of glandular (62.8%) and connective tissues (37.2%). Data on the secretory function duration, which varies from 120 to 42 days, and the productive qualities of the mammary gland (175.7 and 20.3 liters, respectively) in female moose with different activities of coming to the farm for milking are presented and systematized. The clarified features of the activity of the secretory system of the mammary gland of the moose-heifer represent the \u201cstandard.\u201d Thus, they are essential to analyze species characteristics, comparative morphology, and physiology of lactation as a standard criterion for improving animal productivity at the stage of domestication, as well as to organize measures for the prevention of breast diseases in moose. The object of the study is elk cows of the first lactation (n= 221 heads). Depending on the activity of moose coming to the farm during lactation, they were divided into four groups: 1st - with 100% activity, 2nd \u2013 99-80%, 3rd - 79-50%, and 4th \u2013 with 49% activity or less. The scientific information presented in the paper was obtained using morphological, histological, zootechnical, and statistical methods. Morphometric analysis showed the ratio of parenchyma and stroma in the mammary gland in domesticated moose 1.7:1. The glandular apparatus of the udder in the studied female moose secreted significantly higher in animals of the first (duration of lactation 120 days, lactation milk yield \u2013 175.7\u00b13.36 l) and the second groups (109 days and milk yield 122.9 \u00b1 2.31 l) compared to the animals of the third (96 days and a yield of 80.4 \u00b1 3.77 l) and fourth (42 days and a yield of 20.3 \u00b1 1.06 l) groups. The analysis of the secretory activity of the mammary gland in female moose with different activities of coming to milking during the first lactation showed that domestication is a complex and lengthy process. There is still a long and purposeful work to be done to improve the issues of morphology, physiology of the lactation process, and regulation of growth and development of the mammary gland. Moreover, it is essential to organize and improve measures for the raising of moose replacements to transfer them to a milking herd. This will not only domesticate the moose on the farm and strengthen their attachment to humans but also prepare the animals for the upcoming productive period.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["WSEAS

xml:lang=\"en\">The accelerated adoption of distance learning in post-pandemic times has resulted in increasing research publications and review studies in a short time. This necessitates the exploration of a large corpus of academic publications for effective distance learning and learning strategies. As distance learning stakeholders have assimilated the transactional approach to understanding distance learning, transactional distance theory (TDT) is relevant to understand ways to reduce the distance between learners and educators for maximum effectiveness of distance learning. Our study applies TDT to review distance learning from a supply perspective and as a tool to ensure the improved quality of distance learning. This paper has two key contributions: we have presented evidence synthesis and conducted a foresight exercise. Following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, 275 documents published between 1994 and 2022 were identified for review. Our analysis revealed patterns, relationships, and trends in the application of TDT in various distance learning contexts. Most TDT research is conducted in social sciences (83.7%), with computer science accounting for 42.6% of the studies. The course materials\u2019 structure and design have also received considerable attention, with around 40.0% of the research focused on this area. For distance learning, studies revolve around factors such as student engagement, satisfaction, and TDT, which examine the distance between learners and instructors in various learning environments. Through systematic review and meta-analysis, we identify the three thematic areas in TDT research on distance learning. We have chartered themes on the effect of alternate design distance learning platforms on learner success, pushing the development boundaries in distance learning success through TDT, and the practical processes for designing successful distance learning courses via TDT-based pedagogical frameworks. In doing so, we streamline research in TDT and distance learning thematically and provide insight into further work. In addition, this study analyzed the relationships between sustainable development goal (SDG) and TDT literature. The co-citation analysis suggested that the strongest links were observed between education and innovation (SDG 4 and SDG 9), followed by education and gender equality (SDG 4 and SDG 5).<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Contemporary Educational Technology"]},{"DOI":"10.37539\/231024.2023.63.61.072","title":["NATIONAL PECULIARITIES OF SPEECH BEHAVIOR OF NATIVE SPEAKERS OF CHINESE AND RUSSIAN LINGUOCULTURES"],"author":[{"given":"Liliya Igorevna","family":"Kabitenko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This article provides a comparative analysis between Chinese and Russian cultures using the example of Chinese and Russian addresses, expressions of greeting and farewell, respect and politeness, compliments, as well as their acceptance.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Themed collection of papers from Foreign international scientific conference \u00abJoint innovation - joint development\u00bb.

However, heavy metal such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead, which are key for soil dynamics, are not necessary to maintain homeostasis. On the contrary, exacerbated levels of heavy metals in cells induce morphophysiological alterations. Till date, exposure to metal ions has been increasing due to their consumption in junk food; due to environmental or occupational exposure favoring respiratory, gastrointestinal, skeletal muscle and neurological diseases. In peritoneal organs such as the liver and kidney, or thoracic organs for example in lung and heart, the toxic effects are evident by the presence of cell atrophy, edema and inflammation. At the central nervous system level, metal ion-induced neurotoxicity is characterized by increased cellular stress, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The combination of systemic organ failure and neuronal damage might lead to metabolic dysfunction and deregulation in the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters, which could further generate cognitive and motor alterations. In this article, we, for the first time present a brief review of the impact of metal ions, such as cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, as key agents for cell survival. In contrast, the cytotoxic effect of arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead; furthermore, the strategies used for the metal ions-based intoxication detection by clinical analysis or new methods used in scientific research.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["UVserva"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25021175","title":["The Research Progress of Mitochondrial Transplantation in the Treatment of Mitochondrial Defective Diseases"],"author":[{"given":"Cuilan","family":"Hu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Radiation Biology and Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Basic Research on Heavy Ion Radiation Application in Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China"}]},{"given":"Zheng","family":"Shi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Radiation Biology and Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Basic Research on Heavy Ion Radiation Application in Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1048-2758","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xiongxiong","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Radiation Biology and Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Basic Research on Heavy Ion Radiation Application in Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9046-3142","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Chao","family":"Sun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Radiation Biology and Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"Key Laboratory of Basic Research on Heavy Ion Radiation Application in Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China"},{"name":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles that are involved in energy production, apoptosis, and signaling in eukaryotic cells.

Molephantin, a highly oxygenated germacranolide isolated from medicinal plants, Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus, has exhibited anti-tumor, inflammatory, and leishmanicidal activities. Its chemical structure is based on a highly strained ten-membered macrocyclic backbone with an (E,Z)-dienone moiety, which is fused with an a-methylene-g-butyrolactone and adorned with four successive stereogenic centers. Herein, we report the first synthesis of molephantin via 12 steps starting from readily available building blocks. The synthesis is featured by the highly diastereoselective intermolecular Barbier allylation of the b,g-unsaturated aldehyde with optically active 3-bromomethyl-5H-furan-2-one intermediate and ensuing intramolecular Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi (NHK) macrocyclization for the construction of the highly oxygenated ten-membered macrocyclic framework. This synthetic route enabled to craft another germacranolide congener, tomenphantopin F. Furthermore, cycloisomerization of molephantin into 2-deethoxy-2b-hydroxyphantomolin could be facilitated by irradiation with ultraviolet A light (lmax = 370 nm), which opened a versatile and concise access to the related furanogermacranolides such as EM-2, phantomolin, 2-O-demethyltomephantopin C, and tomenphantopin C.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fsoc.2024.1215676","title":["Multiple disadvantages: class, social capital, and well-being of ethnic minority groups in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic"],"author":[{"given":"Yaojun","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lin","family":"Ding","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction<\/jats:title><jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused untold damage to the socio-economic lives of people all over the world.

In this method, point cloud is quickly voxelized, and then the voxels are divided into two types according to the number of points in each voxel: less-point voxel and more-point voxel. Less-point voxels are simplified directly using uniform sampling method. More-point voxels are simplified by using the voxel convex hull method. The convex hull volume and directed projection area of points within each more-point voxel are calculated as voxels\u2019 feature values, and then the point cloud are divided into groups according to the feature values and points in different groups are simplified separately. Finally, the simplified point cloud is obtained by fusing the simplification results of less-point voxels and more-point voxels. The reduction ratio of point cloud is controllable and the parameters are easy to be set in this method. Experiments show that the simplification time of this method is more than 50% lower than that of the simplification method based on curvature and clustering. The retention of point cloud features of this method is obviously higher than that of traditional methods such as uniform sampling method, and the average curvature is improved by about 10%.

MADS-box transcription factors play essential roles in various aspects of plant growth and development as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the use of MADS-box transcription factors to regulate water stress responses has not been fully explored in cotton. Here, we showed that GhAGL16 acts as a negative regulator of water deficit in cotton, at least in part by regulating ABA signaling. GhAGL16-overexpressing (GhAGL16-OE) transgenic Arabidopsis had lower survival rates and relative water contents (RWCs) under water stress. Isolated leaves of GhAGL16-OE Arabidopsis had increased water loss rates, likely attributable to their increased stomatal density. GhAGL16-OE Arabidopsis also showed reduced primary root lengths in response to mannitol treatment and decreased sensitivity of seed germination to ABA treatment. By contrast, silencing GhAGL16 in cotton enhanced tolerance to water deficit by increasing proline (Pro) content, increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents under water stress. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays confirmed that GhAGL16 is a nuclear protein that lacks transcriptional self-activation activity. The expression of ABA biosynthesis-related genes (GhNCED3\/7\/14), a catabolism-related gene (GhCYP707A), and a gene related to the ABA signaling pathway (GhABF4) was altered in GhAGL16-silenced plants.

Rhombus-shaped micro-objects were fabricated from a single spin valve film. The thermomagnetic treatment procedure was found to form unidirectional anisotropy in the micro-object such that the values of the exchange bias fields in the rhombus\u2019 nonparallel sides were opposite in sign. For the CoFeNi\/Ru\/CoFeNi synthetic antiferromagnet, we determined the differences between the ferromagnetic layer thicknesses at which the thermomagnetic treatment formed the same exchange bias all over each rhombus\u2019 side. We also fabricated a sensor element in which each side of the rhombus was the shoulder of a Wheatstone bridge.

Given the growing prevalence of CKD in Mexico and Latin America caused by SAH, there is a need for context-specific approaches to address the effects of SAH, given the diverse population and unique challenges faced by the region. This narrative review provides clinical strategies for healthcare providers on preventing, diagnosing, and treating kidney disease related to SAH, focusing on primary prevention, early detection, evidence-based diagnostic approaches, and selecting pharmacological treatments. Key-strategies are focused on six fundamental areas: 1) Strategies to mitigate kidney disease in SAH, 2) early detection of CKD in SAH, 3) diagnosis and monitoring of SAH, 4) blood pressure targets in patients living with CKD, 5) hypertensive treatment in patients with CKD and 6) diuretics and Non-Steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Inhibitors in Patients with CKD. This review aims to provide relevant strategies for the Mexican and Latin American clinical context, highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to managing SAH, and the role of community-based programs in improving the quality of life for affected individuals.

Through interviews with the KKN Team to the people of Gedang Kulut Village, information was obtained that the community complained about public services. From the observations, it was found that this problem was a bright spot, due to the lack of knowledge and skills of village officials in making public services that could make work easier and easily accessible to the community. A series of student service events that have been carried out have resulted in the village of Gedang Kulut having a website that can support public services. In addition, village officials are also assisted in managing correspondence, then the Gedang Kulut village community can also arrange letters online which can be done anywhere, without having to go to the Gedang Kulut village hall.&#x0D;\nTujuan dari pengabdian ini untuk meningkatkan pelayanan publik di Desa Gedang Kulut, Kecamatan Cerme, Kabupaten Gresik.

Four underlying values structure this account. First, access to the goods and services of the city should not be based purely on the market. Second, each city-zen should be able to live a life they find meaningful. Third, there should be diversity and wide social mixing. Fourth, there should be \u2018non-deferential inclusion\u2019, that is, each person in the city should be able to get access to what they are entitled to without being treated as less worthy than others. They should be able to enjoy their rights without bowing and scraping, waiting longer than others, or going through special bureaucratic hurdles.

To distinguish these models and build quantitative understanding of ORF6 function, we developed a method for scoring both ORF6 concentration and functional effect in single living cells. We combined quantification of untagged ORF6 expression level in single cells with optogenetics-based measurement of nuclear transport kinetics, using methods that could be adapted to measure concentration-dependent effects of any untagged protein. We found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is ~15 times more potent than SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 in inhibiting nuclear import and export, due to differences in the C-terminal region that is required for the NUP98\u2013RAE1 binding. The N-terminal region was required for transport inhibition. This region binds membranes but could be replaced by synthetic constructs which forced oligomerization in solution, suggesting its primary function is oligomerization. We propose that the hydrophobic N-terminal region drives oligomerization of ORF6 to multivalently cross-link the NUP98\u2013RAE1 complexes at the nuclear pore complex, and this multivalent binding inhibits bidirectional transport.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.1177\/03015742231221864","title":["To Evaluate Correlation Between Cervical Vertebral Maturation Stages and Third Molar Maturation Stages in North Maharashtrian Population"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-3441-4722","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Akshay Sunil","family":"Chaugule","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]},{"given":"Kunal Bhaskar","family":"Patil","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]},{"given":"Sunilkumar Laxman","family":"Nagmode","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1620-4505","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hrushikesh Subhash","family":"Aphale","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]},{"given":"Vivek Jayaram","family":"Shinde","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-4954-2563","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sejal Pravin","family":"Surana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SMBT Dental College Sangamner, Maharashtra, India"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Introduction: Assessment of growth is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontics.

However, the mechanism of the molecular interaction between poplars and the two formae speciales, especially for an incompatible system, remains unclear. In this study, we conducted transcriptome sequencing and reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining based on the interactions between Populus canadensis and the two formae speciales. The results show that the gene expression patterns of P. canadensis induced by MO and MU were significantly different, especially for the genes associated with biotic stress. Furthermore, MO and MU also triggered distinct ROS reactions of P. canadensis, and ROS (mainly H2O2) burst was only observed around the cells penetrated by MU.

In order to create a pair with eighth and sixth orders, we need to address a certain known set of equations concerning the coefficients. When constructing such pairs for use in double-precision arithmetic, we often need to meet various conditions. Primarily, we aim to maintain small coefficient magnitudes to prevent a loss of accuracy. Nevertheless, in the context of quadruple precision, we can tolerate larger coefficients. This flexibility enables us to establish pairs with eighth and sixth orders that exhibit significantly reduced truncation errors.

Image deblurring strives to restore clarity to these images. Traditional single-stage methods, while effective in detail enhancement, often neglect global context in favor of local information. Yet, both aspects are crucial, especially in real-life scenarios where images are typically large and subject to various blurs. Addressing this, we introduce CNB Net, an innovative deblurring network adept at integrating global and local insights for enhanced image restoration. The network operates in two stages, utilizing our specially designed Convolution and Normalization-Based Block (CNB Block) and Convolution and Normalization-Based Plus Block (CNBP Block) for multi-scale information extraction. A progressive learning approach is adopted with a Feature Active Selection (FAS) module at the end of each stage that captures spatial detail information under the guidance of real images. The Two-Stage Feature Fusion (TSFF) module reduces information loss caused by downsampling operations while enriching features across stages for increased robustness. We conduct experiments on the GoPro dataset and the HIDE dataset. On the GoPro dataset, our Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) result is 32.21 and the Structural Similarity (SSIM) result is 0.950; and on the HIDE dataset, our PSNR result is 30.38 and the SSIM result is 0.932.

Zoonotic potential of this disease has gained recent attention owing to the re-emergence of disease in several parts of the world. Increased public health concern emphasizes the need for a predictive understanding of the geographic distributional potential of Orf virus. Here, we mapped the current distribution using occurrence records, and estimated the ecological niche in both geographical and environmental spaces. Twenty modeling experiments, resulting from two- and three-partition models, were performed to choose the candidate models that best represent the geographic distributional potential of Orf virus. For all of our models, it was possible to reject the null hypothesis of predictive performance no better than random expectations. However, statistical significance must be accompanied by sufficiently good predictive performance if a model is to be useful. In our case, omission of known distribution of the virus was noticed in all Maxent models, indicating inferior quality of our models. This conclusion was further confirmed by the independent final evaluation, using occurrence records sourced from the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International. Minimum volume ellipsoid (MVE) models indicated the broad range of environmental conditions under which Orf virus infections are found. The excluded climatic conditions from MVEs could not be considered as unsuitable owing to the broad distribution of Orf virus. These results suggest two possibilities: that the niche models fail to identify niche limits that constrain the virus, or that the virus has no detectable niche, as it can be found throughout the geographic distributions of its hosts.

The fucanase, which probably originated in an uncultured planctomycete from the sampled subantarctic sediments, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme catalyzed the rapid hydrolysis of internal glycosidic bonds of fucoidan from Macrocystis pyrifera, a macroalgae species abundant at the site. It was active in a wide range of temperatures (5\u201345 \u00b0C), salinities (9.5\u2013861 mM NaCl), and pH values (4.5\u20139), mainly producing sulfated \u03b1-(1,3)-linked fuco-oligosaccharides of various lengths.

This verse is motivated by a discriminatory tendency embedded in the ontology of the Deuteronomist. Interestingly, Deuteronomy 23:3 was used by Ezra-Nehemiah to discriminate against the \u201cMoabites\u201d during the Second Temple. Such ontology is countered by the author of Ruth in the narrative of Ruth during the Second Temple. This demonstrates an ontological \u201cwar\u201d within the Bible itself. The primary contestation lies in whether God is exclusive or inclusive. This development necessitates a hermeneutics of suspicion. In the course of history, the \u201ctheology\u201d of Deuteronomy has been used to grossly violate the human dignity of many God-fearing African people and many other people of the South for colonial purposes. To exacerbate the situation, there were persistent attempts from some quarters to universalise such a discriminatory biblical perspective. This would feed into the centre\u2013periphery arrangement, with the centre feeding the periphery with such hermeneutics. For this reason, African scholars are implored to be very vigilant against ardent pressures put on the biblical texts by ontological, epistemological, and contextual biases of interpretations. Accordingly, Andrew Mbuvi identifies African Biblical Hermeneutics perfectly when he says it seeks to undo \u201cthe very construct of the \u2018centre-periphery\u2019 binary by allowing the possibility of multiple centres\u201d). Kenneth Ngwa, thus, rightly asserts that African Biblical Hermeneutics considers African epistemologies and conditions \u201cto be invaluable and legitimate contexts and resources in biblical interpretation\u201d), drinking from our own wells). In consequence, this paper intends to set a dialogue between Deuteronomy 23:3 and Ruth 4:18\u201322. This paper aims to examine the understanding of God behind these verses. This paper will then compare the two theologies with the African philosophical concept of God. Harnessing the African concept of Ubuntu, this paper will de-ideologise the two texts and thus will provide a recommendation concerning the two texts.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Religions"]},{"DOI":"10.20870\/oeno-one.2024.58.1.7677","title":["Bridging boundaries: Exploring vineyard, management and variety characteristics influencing long-term infection of grapevine pathogens"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1653-2154","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ivett","family":"Kocsis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6139-8281","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marietta","family":"Petr\u00f3czy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1351-4070","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"G\u00e1bor","family":"Mark\u00f3","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Globalisation, climatic changes, and increasing consumer demand have forced the intensification of agricultural production. Thus, vineyards have crossed the boundaries of the original production zones and extended towards suboptimal areas, increasing the potential risk of damaging disease outbreaks. Therefore, there is a rising need for a complex and empirical revision of the interfering effects between grape infection and other external, large-scale factors such as environmental conditions and management practices. Although external abiotic and biotic factors could determine the infection levels of grape disease in a complex way, existing studies focus on the short-term effects of only a single or very few potential factors. In this large-scale study, we aimed to reveal the long-term impact of specific factors regarding vineyard characteristics, applied crop management and grape variety features, which could determine the infection severity of primary grape diseases (grey mould, downy mildew and powdery mildew) using a citizen science approach in Hungary, a traditional wine- and grape-producing country. The present study has revealed that some vineyards (e.g., inclination, row orientation) and variety features (e.g., bunch structure) were considered crucial. At the same time, other factors were found to be less relevant in the present complex comparison, suggesting that the role of these factors might be overemphasised in the literature. In conclusion, the susceptibility or tolerance of grapevines to pathogens appears to be an integrated effect of several factors and cannot be assigned to a single characteristic. The global changes urge the revision of conventional agricultural traditions and deepen our knowledge about the infection process and pathogen-host-environment interactions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["OENO One"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/microorganisms12010196","title":["Diverse Small Circular DNA Viruses Identified in an American Wigeon Fecal Sample"],"author":[{"given":"Diego","family":"Olivo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85042, USA"}]},{"given":"Anthony","family":"Khalifeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85042, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9963-1133","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joy M.","family":"Custer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85042, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7037-9242","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Simona","family":"Kraberger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85042, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4111-2415","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Arvind","family":"Varsani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics, Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85042, USA"},{"name":"Structural Biology Research Unit, Department of Integrative, Biomedical Sciences, University of Cape Town, Observatory, Cape Town 7925, South Africa"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>American wigeons (Mareca americana) are waterfowls that are widely distributed throughout North America.

In this review, we examined the impact of adipocytes on cancer by describing the adipocyte-secreted factors that are involved in controlling metastatic cancer, focusing on adipokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, chemerin, resistin, apelin, and omentin. Adipocyte-secreted factors promote cancer metastasis and contribute to various biological functions of cancer cells, including migration, invasion, proliferation, immune evasion, and drug resistance at the metastatic sites. We propose the establishment and expansion of \u201cadipo-oncology\u201d as a research field to enhance the comprehensive understanding of the role of adipocytes in metastatic cancers and the development of more robust metastatic cancer treatments.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cell Communication and Signaling"]},{"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198872221.003.0012","title":["The Paradox of Delusions"],"author":[{"given":"Nicholas","family":"Furl","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Max","family":"Coltheart","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ryan","family":"McKay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Delusions are pathological beliefs, often with bizarre content. They feature in neurological disorders and in psychoses associated with psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). This chapter reviews two apparently opposing ways that the research literature characterizes delusions. While delusions are often defined as beliefs that are rigid and unaffected by evidence, they are also frequently conceptualized as beliefs that are unduly swayed by minimal, insufficient evidence. The authors review empirical studies and theory from psychology, neuroscience, and computational psychiatry which embody this contrast. Prevailing perspectives, they show, frame belief formation as a process of integrating new evidence into existing beliefs. This view tends to sculpt hypotheses about delusions (and other psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations) into two types. First, relevant evidence fails to affect prior beliefs, which are too entrenched. Second, evidence overly dominates prior beliefs, which have too weak an influence. This paradox calls for a profound rethinking of these perplexing and distressing symptoms.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Belief, Imagination, and Delusion"]},{"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-3857130\/v1","title":["Impacts of land use type on sampling methods for human and simian malaria vectors"],"author":[{"given":"Bram van","family":"de Straat","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"James Cook University"}]},{"given":"Ahadi","family":"Kurniawan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Public Health Laboratory of Medan, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia"}]},{"given":"Boni","family":"Sebayang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"James Cook University"}]},{"given":"Triwibowo Ambar","family":"Garjito","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"National Research and Innovation Agency"}]},{"given":"Inke Nadia D.","family":"Lubis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Universitas Sumatera Utara"}]},{"given":"Tanya L.","family":"Russell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"James Cook University"}]},{"given":"Thomas R.","family":"Burkot","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"James Cook University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n Malaria transmission to humans is increasing in complexity in Indonesia with simian malaria cases in humans increasing as human malaria incidence diminishes.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common out of the three clinical types of Leishmaniasis. Since 1904 this disease has been endemic in Sri Lanka. CL is considered a disfiguring stigmatising disease with a higher psychosocial burden. However, there needs to be a more in-depth, holistic understanding of the psychosocial burden of this disease, both locally and internationally. An in-depth understanding of the disease burden beyond morbidity and mortality is required to provide people-centred care. We explored the psychosocial burden of CL in rural Sri Lanka using a complex multimethod qualitative approach with community engagement and involvement. Data collection included participant observation, an auto-ethnographic diary study by community researchers with post-diary interviews, and a Participant Experience Reflection Journal (PERJ) study with post-PERJ interviews with community members with CL. The thematic analysis revealed three major burden-related themes on perceptions and reflections on the disease: wound, treatment, and illness-experience related burden. Fear, disgust, body image concerns, and being subjected to negative societal reactions were wound-related. Treatment interfering with day-to-day life, pain, the time-consuming nature of the treatment, problems due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment, and the burden of attending a government hospital clinic were the treatment-related burdens. Anxiety\/worry due to wrongly perceived disease severity and negative emotions due to the nature of the disease made the illness experience more burdensome. Addressing the multifaceted psychosocial burden is paramount to ensure healthcare seeking, treatment compliance, and disease control and prevention. We propose a people-centred healthcare model to understand the contextual nature of the disease and improve patient outcomes.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases"]},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-51687-3","title":["Integrated image and sensor-based food intake detection in free-living"],"author":[{"given":"Tonmoy","family":"Ghosh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yue","family":"Han","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Viprav","family":"Raju","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Delwar","family":"Hossain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Megan A.","family":"McCrory","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Janine","family":"Higgins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Carol","family":"Boushey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Edward J.","family":"Delp","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Edward","family":"Sazonov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The first step in any dietary monitoring system is the automatic detection of eating episodes.

Thirty participants wore the AIM-2 for two days each (pseudo-free-living and free-living). The eating episodes were detected by three methods: (1) recognition of solid foods and beverages in images captured by AIM-2; (2) recognition of chewing from the AIM-2 accelerometer sensor; and (3) hierarchical classification to combine confidence scores from image and accelerometer classifiers. The integration of image- and sensor-based methods achieved 94.59% sensitivity, 70.47% precision, and 80.77% F1-score in the free-living environment, which is significantly better than either of the original methods (8% higher sensitivity).

Existing resonance suppression strategies are usually designed for specific scenarios which are in close correlation with the impedance frequency-amplitude distribution, and their adaptability under different scenarios is hard to evaluate. In this paper, the resonance suppression domain of a DC distribution network is derived based on the node impedance variation before\/after the resonance is suppressed. The derived criterion takes the admittance change of the resonance suppression strategies as variables, and the conservative\/ideal suppression domain criteria are defined. On this basis, a method for evaluating the effectiveness of resonance suppression strategies is proposed, which simplifies the evaluation process and avoids a complicated matrix inverse process to each resonance suppression strategy during the system impedance calculation. Furthermore, a DC active damper control strategy based on the resonance suppression strategy evaluation is proposed, and the proposed strategy could suppress resonances under different scenarios by a targeted design of the reshaping admittance parameters. Time domain simulations with a 5-node distribution network are carried out to verify the proposed

In coastal zones, a major objective of groundwater management is often to determine sustainable pumping rates which avoid well salinization. Understanding how model and climate uncertainties affect optimal management solutions is essential for providing groundwater managers with information about salinization risk and is facilitated by the use of optimization under uncertainty (OUU) methods. However, guidelines are missing for the widespread implementation of OUU in real-world coastal aquifers and for the incorporation of climate uncertainty into OUU approaches. An ensemble-based OUU approach was developed considering parameter, observation and climate uncertainty and was implemented in a real-world island aquifer in the Magdalen Islands (Quebec, Canada). A sharp-interface seawater intrusion model was developed using MODFLOW-SWI2 and a prior parameter ensemble was generated containing multiple equally plausible realizations. Ensemble-based history matching was conducted using an iterative ensemble smoother which yielded a posterior parameter ensemble conveying both parameter and observation uncertainty. Sea level and recharge ensembles were generated for the year 2050 and were then used to generate a predictive parameter ensemble conveying parameter, observation and climate uncertainty. Multi-objective OUU was then conducted, aiming to both maximize pumping rates and minimize the probability of well salinization. As a result, the optimal trade-off between pumping and the probability of salinization was quantified considering parameter, historical observation and future climate uncertainty simultaneously. The multi-objective, ensemble-based OUU led to optimal pumping rates that were very different from a previous deterministic OUU and close to the current and projected water demand for risk-averse stances. Incorporating climate uncertainty into the OUU was also critical since it reduced the maximum allowable pumping rates for users with a risk-averse stance. The workflow used tools adapted to very high-dimensional, nonlinear models and optimization problems to facilitate its implementation in a wide range of real-world settings.\n                    <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Hydrology and Earth System Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.51302\/rcyt.2024.20237","title":["La contabilidad como medio de prueba para acreditar la prescripci\u00f3n de la renta presunta que se deriva del registro de una deuda inexistente"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2191-1594","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Luis A.","family":"Malv\u00e1rez Pascual","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>En el presente trabajo se analizan las consecuencias de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la presunci\u00f3n que permite derivar una renta del descubrimiento del registro contable de una deuda inexistente.

The study described in this paper follows the line of study in which the monomiality principle is used to develop new results. It is further discovered that these polynomials satisfy various well-known fundamental properties and explicit forms. The explicit series representation of\u00a0\u2206h bivariate Gould\u2013Hopper polynomials is first obtained, and, using this outcome, the explicit series representation of the\u00a0\u2206h bivariate Appell polynomials is further given. The quasimonomial properties fulfilled by bivariate Appell polynomials\u00a0\u2206h are also proved by demonstrating that the\u00a0\u2206h bivariate Appell polynomials exhibit certain properties related to their behavior under multiplication and differentiation operators. The determinant form of\u00a0\u2206h bivariate Appell polynomials is provided, and symmetric identities for the\u00a0\u2206h bivariate Appell polynomials are also exhibited.

Meropenem is a commonly used therapeutic agent, although emergent resistance occurs during treatment. We used a rabbit HAP infection model to assess the bacterial kill and resistance pharmacodynamics of meropenem. Meropenem 5 mg\/kg administered subcutaneously (s.c.) q8h (\u00b1amikacin 3.33\u20135 mg\/kg q8h administered intravenously[i.v.]) or meropenem 30 mg\/kg s.c. q8h regimens were assessed in a rabbit lung infection model infected with\n            <jats:italic>P. aeruginosa<\/jats:italic>\n            , with bacterial quantification and phenotypic\/genotypic characterization of emergent resistant isolates. The pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic output was fitted to a mathematical model, and human-like regimens were simulated to predict outcomes in a clinical context. Increasing meropenem monotherapy demonstrated a dose-response effect to bacterial kill and an inverted U relationship with emergent resistance. The addition of amikacin to meropenem suppressed the emergence of resistance. A network of porin loss, efflux upregulation, and increased expression of AmpC was identified as the mechanism of this emergent resistance. A bridging simulation using human pharmacokinetics identified meropenem 2 g i.v. q8h as the licensed clinical regimen most likely to suppress resistance. We demonstrate an innovative experimental platform to phenotypically and genotypically characterize bacterial emergent resistance pharmacodynamics in HAP. For meropenem, we have demonstrated the risk of resistance emergence during therapy and identified two mitigating strategies: (i) regimen intensification and (ii) use of combination therapy. This platform will allow pre-clinical assessment of emergent resistance risk during treatment of HAP for other antimicrobials, to allow construction of clinical regimens that mitigate this risk.\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>IMPORTANCE<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>\n              The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) during antimicrobial treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a well-documented problem (particularly in pneumonia caused by\n              <jats:italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/jats:italic>\n              ) that contributes to the wider global antimicrobial resistance crisis. During drug development, regimens are typically determined by their sufficiency to achieve bactericidal effect.

The innovative experimental platform described here allows characterization of the emergence of AMR during the treatment of HAP and the development of strategies to mitigate this. We have demonstrated this specifically for meropenem\u2014a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used to treat HAP.

While various sensor configurations have been suggested in the literature, depending on the sensors\u2019 type, number, and size, a comprehensive understanding of optimizing these parameters for precise temperature reconstruction is still lacking. This study addresses this gap by introducing a tool based on a theoretical model to optimize the placement of fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBG) within the organ undergoing ablation. The theoretical model serves as a general framework, allowing for adaptation to various situations. In practical application, the model provides a foundational structure, with the flexibility to tailor specific optimal solutions by adjusting problem-specific data. We propose a nonlinear and nonconvex (and, thus, only solvable in an approximated manner) optimization formulation to determine the optimal distribution and three-dimensional placement of FBG arrays. The optimization aims to find a trade-off among two objectives: maximizing the variance of the expected temperatures measured by the sensors, which can be obtained from a predictive simulation that considers both the type of applicator used and the specific organ involved, and maximizing the squared sum of the distances between the sensor pairs. The proposed approach provides a trade-off between collecting diverse temperatures and not having all the sensors concentrated in a single area. We address the optimization problem through the utilization of approximation schemes in programming. We then substantiate the efficacy of this approach through simulations. This study tackles optimizing the FBGs\u2019 sensor placement for precise temperature monitoring during tumor ablation. Optimizing the FBG placement enhances temperature mapping, aiding in tumor cell eradication while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Sensors"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/electronics13020394","title":["Integration of ShuffleNet V2 and YOLOv5s Networks for a Lightweight Object Detection Model of Electric Bikes within Elevators"],"author":[{"given":"Jingfang","family":"Su","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Information Science, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China"}]},{"given":"Minrui","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Information Science, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China"}]},{"given":"Xinliang","family":"Tang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Information Science, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang 050018, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The entry of electric bikes into elevators poses safety risks.

Swin Transformer modules are introduced between layers to enhance the feature expression capability of images, and a SimAM attention mechanism is applied at the end layer to further improve the feature extraction capability of the backbone network. In the neck network, lightweight and depth-balanced GSConv and VoV-GSCSP modules replace several Conv and C3 basic convolutional modules, reducing the parameter count while enhancing the cross-scale connection and fusion capabilities of feature maps. The prediction network uses the faster-converging and more accurate EIOU error function as the position loss function for iterative training. This article conducts various lightweighting comparison experiments and ablation experiments on the improved object detection model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed object detection model, with a model size of only 2.6 megabytes and 1.1 million parameters, achieves a frame rate of 106 frames per second and a detection accuracy of 95.5%.

Retinal vessel segmentation from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) volumes is significant in analyzing blood supply structures and the diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. However, accurate retinal vessel segmentation in 3D OCTA remains challenging due to the interference of choroidal blood flow signals and the variations in retinal vessel structure. Approach. This paper proposes a layer attention network (LA-Net) for 3D-to-2D retinal vessel segmentation. The network comprises a 3D projection path and a 2D segmentation path. The key component in the 3D path is the proposed multi-scale layer attention module, which effectively learns the layer features of OCT and OCTA to attend to the retinal vessel layer while suppressing the choroidal vessel layer. This module also efficiently captures 3D multi-scale information for improved semantic understanding during projection. In the 2D path, a reverse boundary attention module is introduced to explore and preserve boundary and shape features of retinal vessels by focusing on non-salient regions in deep features. Main results. Experimental results in two subsets of the OCTA-500 dataset showed that our method achieves advanced segmentation performance with Dice similarity coefficients of 93.04% and 89.74%, respectively.

It can be said that The Tempest stages Machiavelli, giving sensitive expression to concepts such as New Principality, Fortune and Virt\u00fa and power and freedom. In relation to Hobbes, Shakespeare elucidates in an exemplary excerpt the origin of the leviathan, indicating the details of the physical violence and the moral order exercised by the sovereign (by nature and by institution). Being the last play written by William Shakespeare, this author became aware of Montaigne's texts and brings from them notions such as a new world and the desire for utopia, having sought out European poles at the time. In turn, the idea of \u201cfreedom\u201d is constituted in the play as a clue to articulate all the other political concepts that permeate Shakespeare\u2019s text. Thus, it can be said that in this playwright there is a systematized political thought based not only on the astute analyzes of the political situations of his time, but, mainly, on the articulation of notions originating from the political philosophy produced in his time. Ultimately, Shakespeare stages not only Machiavelli, but also brings Hobbes and Montaigne to the political scene.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Political Philosophy, Theory, Art and Politics, Shakespeare, Machiavelli.&#x0D;\n\u00a0&#x0D;\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: Prenant comme r\u00e9f\u00e9rence la pi\u00e8ce La Temp\u00eate (1611) de William Shakespeare, l\u2019essai s\u2019adresse les relations th\u00e9oriques \u00e9tablies entre Nicolas Machiavel, Thomas Hobbes, Montaigne et Shakespeare. On peut dire que La Temp\u00eate met en sc\u00e8ne Machiavel, donnant une expression sensible \u00e0 des concepts tels que la Nouvelle Principaut\u00e9, la Fortune et la Virt\u00fa, ainsi que le pouvoir et la libert\u00e9. A propos de Hobbes, Shakespeare explicite dans un extrait exemplaire l'origine du L\u00e9viathan, indiquant les d\u00e9tails de la violence physique et de l'ordre moral exerc\u00e9 par le souverain (par nature et par institution).

Se puede decir que La Tempestad escenifica a Maquiavelo, dando expresi\u00f3n sensible a conceptos como Nuevo Principado, Fortuna y Virt\u00fa y poder y libertad. En relaci\u00f3n con Hobbes, Shakespeare aclara en un extracto ejemplar el origen del leviat\u00e1n, indicando los detalles de la violencia f\u00edsica y del orden moral ejercido por el soberano (por naturaleza y por instituci\u00f3n).

integrity of the gas pipeline in the coal-gas co-mining subsidence area has become a critical problem, restricting the safe and efficient mining of coal resources. This paper establishes a theoretical model for the safety prediction of gas pipelines in mining subsidence areas based on elastic free theory, constructs a 3D model of pipe-sand soil by using ABAQUS simulation software (2021), analyzes the characteristics of ground surface and pipeline settlement combined with the measured data on-site, and reveals the temporal and spatial evolution law of the pipeline load and deformation under the condition of diagonal intersections of the pipeline and high-strength mining working face. The results show that during the mining cycle, the pipe and the sandy soil body experienced the stage of cooperative deformation, the stage of increasing non-cooperative deformation, and the stage of weakening non-cooperative deformation; the pipe body is most vulnerable to yield failure in the circumferential direction of 180\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 225\u00b0, and 0\u00b0; the relative deformation rate of the pipe experienced a slow and rapid increase in the stage, and tends to flatten out when the advancement length is about 1.5\u20132 times the distance at the taken cross-section.

Focusing on wild meat hunting, a substantial livelihood and food source in tropical regions, we evaluated the impacts of the shock from Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown on species exploitation around a global biodiversity hotspot. Using a three-year quantitative dataset collected during and after the lockdown (covering 1,008 hunter-months) and matching by time of year, we found that successful hunting trip rates were more frequent during lockdown, with a corresponding increase in the monthly number, mass, and value of animals caught. Moreover, hunters consumed a larger proportion of wild meat and sold less during lockdown compared to non-lockdown periods. These results suggest that local communities relied on wild meat to supplement reduced food and income during lockdown, buffering COVID-19\u2019s socio-economic shock. Our findings also indicate that wild species may be especially vulnerable to increased hunting pressure during such shocks.<\/p>"},{"DOI":"10.37539\/231024.2023.75.36.002","title":["THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING IN POLE VAULTING FOR WOMEN"],"author":[{"given":"Vladimir Igorevich","family":"Nikonov","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The article gives comparative analysis of the technique jump from the pole in the performance of girls 17-19 years universally jump style, and provides variants of techniques which use sportswomen at the stage profound specialization.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Themed collection of papers from Foreign international scientific conference \u00abJoint innovation - joint development\u00bb.

However, these models are not yet scaled up across sectors. One of the barriers is understanding how consumers perceive sustainable business models and how much they would be ready to pay products and services from sustainable offerings. To this extent, our study investigated the following research questions: How do consumers perceive the sustainability attributes of novel sustainable business models? How does this affect consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the offering provided? This study uses a qualitative research approach, conducting online discussions among 44 Finnish consumers. Finland is in focus as it has a top ranking in sustainability country indexes. Through the study, it was found that consumers pay attention to sustainability of the products and services they consume. They are willing to use available information and assess this to make sustainable purchasing decisions. However, they lack trustworthy information and sometimes it is too time-consuming to find the data. When making purchasing decisions, consumers perceive certain positive environmental and social impacts. However, the environmental and social impact of the studied business models did not turn into consumer WTP especially when considering expensive products, or business models with a social impact only. Still, in general, over half of the participants are willing to pay more about responsible produced products.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Circular Economy and Sustainability"]},{"DOI":"10.1097\/moh.0000000000000802","title":["Vascular microphysiological systems"],"author":[{"given":"Sarah E.","family":"Shelton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Purpose of review<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This review summarizes innovations in vascular microphysiological systems (MPS) and discusses the themes that have emerged from recent works.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Recent findings<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Vascular MPS are increasing in complexity and ability to replicate tissue.

The book examines modern idolatries and the ways in which humans become dominated by our own creations. While critical of modern idolatries, the argument is also sympathetic, seeing in idolatry a deep longing in the human heart for the transformation of our lives. Max Weber is often credited with proclaiming that the modern world is disenchanted, but Weber himself did not buy the story of disenchantment as it is usually presented. Ranging widely across the fields of history, philosophy, political science, sociology, and cultural studies, the book develops an alternative account of modernity as not the condition of being disenchanted but the condition of having learned to describe the world as disenchanted. For a better description of the world, the book turns to scriptural, theological, and phenomenological accounts of idolatry as inordinate devotion to created things. Through explorations of nationalism and consumer culture, it presents a sympathetic but critical account of how and why we sacrifice ourselves and others to gods of our own design. It explores incarnation and sacrament as ways toward healing idolatry by finding God in things without making gods of things. Ultimately, the best remedy for idolatry is an uncontrollable encounter with the incarnate God in the form of those who are marginalized by idolatrous systems.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-51391-2","title":["Phytoassisted synthesis of CuO and Ag\u2013CuO nanocomposite, characterization, chemical sensing of ammonia, degradation of methylene blue"],"author":[{"given":"Muhammad","family":"Farooq","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shaukat","family":"Shujah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kamran","family":"Tahir","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Syed Tasleem","family":"Hussain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Afaq Ullah","family":"Khan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zainab M.","family":"Almarhoon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Khulood Fahad","family":"Alabbosh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abdulaziz A.","family":"Alanazi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Talal M.","family":"Althagafi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Magdi E.

A simple novel synthetic method was reported in which new plant material <jats:italic>Capparis decidua<\/jats:italic> was used for the reduction and stabilization of the synthesized nanocatalyst. A Varying amount of Ag was doped into CuO to optimize the best catalyst that met the required objectives. Through this, the Ag\u2013CuO nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, EDX, and FTIR techniques. The mechanism of increased catalytic activity with Ag doping involves the formation of charge sink and suppression of drop back probability of charge from conduction to valance band. Herein, 2.7\u00a0mol % Ag\u2013CuO exhibited better catalytic activities and it was used through subsequent catalytic experiments. The experimental conditions such as pH, catalyst dose, analyte initial concentration, and contact time were optimized. The as-synthesized nanocomposite demonstrates an excellent degradation efficacy of MB which is 97% at pH 9. More interestingly, the as-synthesized catalyst was successfully applied for the chemical sensing of ammonia even at very low concentrations. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) also called analytic sensitivity was calculated for ammonia sensing and found to be 1.37\u00a0ppm.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Scientific Reports"]},{"DOI":"10.58351\/231125.2023.76.11.003","title":["\u0422\u0412\u041e\u0420\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0415 \u0417\u0410\u0414\u0410\u041d\u0418\u042f \u041d\u0410 \u0423\u0420\u041e\u041a\u0410\u0425 \u041e\u0421\u041d\u041e\u0412\u042b \u0411\u0415\u0417\u041e\u041f\u0410\u0421\u041d\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 \u0416\u0418\u0417\u041d\u0415\u0414\u0415\u042f\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418"],"author":[{"given":"\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041e\u043c\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430","family":"\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0439","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"\u0421\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044b\u043a\u043c\u0430\u0430 \u041a\u044b\u0437\u044b\u043b-\u043e\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430","family":"\u0421\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0433","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439. \u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u00ab\u041e\u0411\u0416\u00bb \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f, \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043a \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438.<\/jats:p>\n                                                                            <jats:p>The article discusses methods for developing creative tasks.

A total of 551 high-risk infants were randomly recruited from 3 European countries in three feeding regimens: exclusive breastfeeding, partially hydrolyzed formula, or standard formula with intact protein either exclusively or supplementary to breastfeeding. During the first 6 months of intervention, amongst infants with a family history of atopic dermatitis, 6.5% of partially hydrolyzed formula-fed infants and 22.7% of exclusively breastfed infants (p = 0.007) presented with atopic dermatitis respectively. Growth as assessed by weight increase did not differ between the aforementioned groups. Although cow\u2019s milk protein allergy was not related to the different milk feeding regimens in the whole cohort, when adjusting for high breast milk intake, the respective incident was significantly lower in the infants consuming partially hydrolyzed formula (p &amp;#x3c; 0.001).

In recent years, there have been reports that serum creatinine and cystatin C (Cr\/CysC) ratio is associated with sarcopenia. However, the prognostic value of the Cr\/CysC ratio in biliary tract cancer is unclear. We evaluated the impact of the Cr\/CysC ratio on sarcopenia and prognosis in biliary tract cancer.\nMethods\n We retrospectively reviewed the records of 190 patients with biliary tract cancer who had undergone surgical resection from January 2017 to March 2023. Frozen serum samples collected at the time of surgery were used to measure CysC. We calculated the Cr\/CysC ratio and investigated the relationship with sarcopenia and the prognostic significance.\nResults\n Serum Cr\/CysC ratio was statistically related to both skeletal muscle index and handgrip strength, both of which are diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia (skeletal muscle index: R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u2009=\u20090.096, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001, handgrip strength: R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>\u2009=\u20090.20, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The optimal cutoff value of the Cr\/CysC ratio for sarcopenia was 0.848. The low Cr\/CysC ratio group was significantly associated with higher preoperative CRP and lower albumin, lower skeletal muscle index, lower handgrip strength, and higher intramuscular adipose tissue content. In multivariate analysis, patients with a low Cr\/CysC ratio showed poorer overall survival (hazard ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 1.07\u20136.29, p\u2009=\u20090.033), which was significantly worse than in those with a high Cr\/CysC ratio.\nConclusions\n The Cr\/CysC ratio could be used as a marker to evaluate sarcopenia in patients with biliary tract cancer.

Different methods of maxillary expansion should be carried out depending on the midpalatal suture maturation levels, and the diagnosis was validated by palatal plane cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images by orthodontists, while such a method suffered from low efficiency and strong subjectivity. This study develops and evaluates an enhanced vision transformer (ViT) to automatically classify CBCT images of midpalatal sutures with different maturation stages.\nMethods\n In recent years, the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of midpalatal suture with different maturation stages has brought positive significance to the decision of the clinical maxillary expansion method. However, CNN cannot adequately learn the long-distance dependencies between images and features, which is also required for global recognition of midpalatal suture CBCT images. The Self-Attention of ViT has the function of capturing the relationship between long-distance pixels of the image. However, it lacks the inductive bias of CNN and needs more data training. To solve this problem, a CNN-enhanced ViT model based on transfer learning is proposed to classify midpalatal suture CBCT images. In this study, 2518 CBCT images of the palate plane are collected, and the images are divided into 1259 images as the training set, 506 images as the verification set, and 753 images as the test set. After the training set image preprocessing, the CNN-enhanced ViT model is trained and adjusted, and the generalization ability of the model is tested on the test set.\nResults\n The classification accuracy of our proposed ViT model is 95.75%, and the AUC is 97.3% on our data test set. The classification accuracy of the clinician is 89.10% on our data test set.\nConclusions\n The experimental results show that this method can effectively complete CBCT images classification of midpalatal suture maturation stages, and the performance is better than a clinician. Therefore, the model can provide a valuable reference for orthodontists and assist them in making correct a diagnosis.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.54536\/ajaset.v8i1.2394","title":["Reference Evapotranspiration Modeling Using Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches: A Bibliometric Analysis"],"author":[{"given":"Ahmed","family":"Skhiri","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ali","family":"Ferhi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anis","family":"Bousselmi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Slaheddine","family":"Khlifi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>A bibliometric analysis was performed over the period 1992\u20132023, to pinpoint important trends, emphasis, and geographic distribution of international reference evapotranspiration (ETo) modeling research using intelligence-based approaches.

These waters could be classified based on geological formations, yielding two primary water types in the area. The first type, characterized by Ca2+ - Mg2+ - HCO3-  is prevalent in Triassic terrigenous sediments. The second type is a mixed water type, ranging from Ca2+ - Mg2+ - Cl- to Ca2+ - Na+ - HCO3-, primarily distributed in Permian felsic volcanic formations. These distinct water types are primarily the result of interactions between water and rock, precipitation processes, and ion exchange phenomena. Geochemical simulation results demonstrated the supersaturation of aragonite, calcite, and dolomite minerals, leading to the precipitation of carbonate minerals. Concurrently, the simulation indicated a tendency to dissolve minerals such as fluorite, gypsum, halite, and sylvite. The assessment of water quality using the WQI indicates that, in accordance with QCVN 01-1:2018\/BYT 2018 standards, the majority of groundwater and streamwater are suitable for domestic use. However, exceptions exist in certain sample locations where water quality exceeds permissible standards, primarily due to elevated levels of Fe, Mn, and NO3- concentration. Hence, it is important to implement water treatment processes for the water sourced from these specific locations before their utilization in daily activities to ensure the safety and well-being of the local population.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Environmental Research Communications"]},{"DOI":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/ad19ed","title":["Winter post-droughts amplify extreme nitrate concentrations in German rivers"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8975-9747","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Felipe","family":"Saavedra","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0115-1359","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andreas","family":"Musolff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2111-0001","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jana","family":"Von Freyberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3698-2339","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Ralf","family":"Merz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kay","family":"Kn\u00f6ller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Christin","family":"M\u00fcller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8824-877X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Manuela","family":"Brunner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7675-0751","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Larisa","family":"Tarasova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Hydrological extremes can affect nutrient export from catchments to streams, posing a threat to aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the effects of hydrological drought on nitrate concentrations in the streamflow of 182 German catchments from 1980 to 2020. We found that across all seasons, 40% and 25% of the catchments showed significantly lower nitrate concentrations during drought and post-droughts, respectively, when compared to non-drought conditions. However, we observed pronounced spatial variability in the responses, particularly during winter droughts and post-droughts, with more catchments exhibiting higher nitrate concentrations. Specifically, nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in 25% of the study catchments during winter droughts, particularly in wetter catchments with low nitrogen retention. During winter post-droughts, nitrate concentrations are significantly higher in 19% of the catchments, especially in wetter catchments with more nitrogen surplus. Moreover, the likelihood of nitrate seasonal extremes increased by 6% during winter post-drought in our study catchments. Considering the projected increase in the frequency of droughts in Germany, the increase in nitrate concentrations during the corresponding post-drought periods poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystem health.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Environmental Research Letters"]},{"DOI":"10.11646\/zootaxa.5403.2.7","title":["Taxonomic study of Uncobotyodes Kirti &amp; Rose, 1990 (Lepidoptera, Crambidae), with the description of a new species from China"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-7030-3907","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"SHI-QI","family":"HUANG","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7796-7303","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"XI-CUI","family":"DU","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The monotypic genus Uncobotyodes Kirti &amp; Rose and its type species U. patulalis (Walker) are redescribed.

Four rams and four ewes from each of these lines were reared up to one year of age under optimal growth conditions and shorn at the end of that time. Fleeces were weighed and samples collected for analysis. Neither sex nor genotype influenced clean fleece weight or clean yield percentage, but fibre diameter differed between genotypes. Purebred Merino had the finest wool (18.26 \u03bcm) and the Merino x Dormer cross the coarsest (26.01 \u03bcm). However, all lines still produced wool that could be used in manufacturing clothing, while fleeces showed good uniformity. The two purebred lines had the highest comfort factor (&gt; 98%). The crossbred lines produced a similar quantity of wool as the purebreds, although of poorer quality.

Accordingly, several nationality sentiments that were sidelined earlier have now become salient. While the India factor in these competing perspectives of nationalism discourses in Nepal appears to be subtle (but important), the growing territorial dimensions to it invariably locates India in a prominent position.

We found that circ_0001756 was associated with the malignant potential of BC.

Mechanistically, circ_0001756 acted as a miR-584-5p sponge to regulate TRAF6 in BC cells. Serum levels of circ_0001756 were significantly higher in pre-operative BC patients than in healthy controls, fibroadenoma patients, and post-operative BC patients. Also, serum circ_0001756 was remarkably correlated with tumor size, patient age, metastasis state, and TNM stage. The combination of the traditional tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 15\u2009\u2212\u20093 with circ_0001756 significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of BC.\nConclusion\n Circ_0001756 promotes the malignancy of BC through the miR-584-5p\/TRAF6 signaling axis.

The similarities between MNOs and their corresponding parental tumors were confirmed by both IHC and whole-exome sequencing.

TEW-specific composites for the satellite-observed vertical structure of diabatic heating are compared to similar terms from MERRA-2 across a variety of tropical regions. There are striking differences between the reanalysis and satellite heating with MERRA-2 having much stronger background heating, especially at low levels. Both the satellite-observed and reanalysis heating profiles show stronger mid-level heating associated with TEWs relative to the unconditional background. Similar patterns of mid- and bottom-heaviness emerge in two-dimensional composites of TEW latent heating as stronger heating rates and percent contributions to the background are generally higher at 500 hPa than 850 hPa.

The ministry\u2019s relationships with Hobbes and Hobbesian discourse are much discussed; but these discussions are restricted thematically and geographically. This chapter recovers a debate about the government of empire which divided the Cabal ministry. It shows that Hobbes intervened in this debate, broadly on the same side as Arlington, and argues that Petty used Hobbes\u2019s concepts of subjecthood, sovereignty, conquest, and the church to do the same. In both his texts, Petty thought with Hobbes to argue for reforms to imperial government and trade, a British union, and the incorporation of Irish Catholics into a British state.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Thomas Hobbes and Political Thought in Ireland c.1660- c.1730"]},{"DOI":"10.1017\/s0956792523000360","title":["Recurrent and chaotic outbreaks in SIR model"],"author":[{"given":"Chunyi","family":"Gai","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Theodore","family":"Kolokolnikov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jan","family":"Schrader","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vedant","family":"Sharma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>We examine several extensions to the basic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, which are able to induce recurrent outbreaks (the basic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model by itself does not exhibit recurrent outbreaks).

In the limit of slow immunity loss, we derive asymptotic thresholds that characterise this transition. In the outbreak regime, we use asymptotic matching to obtain a two-dimensional discrete map which describes outbreak times and strength. We then analyse the resulting map using linear stability and numerics. As the frequency of forcing is increased, the map exhibits a period-doubling route to chaos which alternates with periodic outbreaks of increasing frequency.

Carbon-11 is produced for this purpose with a cyclotron, nowadays almost exclusively by the 14N(p,\u03b1)11C nuclear reaction, either on nitrogen containing a low concentration of oxygen (0.1\u20130.5%) or hydrogen (~5%) to produce [11C]carbon dioxide or [11C]methane, respectively. These primary radioactive products can be produced in high yields and with high molar activities. However, only [11C]carbon dioxide has some utility for directly labeling PET tracers. Primary products are required to be converted rapidly and efficiently into secondary labeling synthons to provide versatile radiochemistry for labeling diverse tracer chemotypes at molecular positions of choice. This review surveys known gas phase transformations of carbon-11 and summarizes the important roles that many of these transformations now play for producing a broad range of labeling synthons in carbon-11 chemistry.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Molecular Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijerph21010108","title":["Pilot Implementation of a Nutrition-Focused Community-Health-Worker Intervention among Formerly Chronically Homeless Adults in Permanent Supportive Housing"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2109-1506","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jane E.","family":"Hamilton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4630-6585","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Diana C.","family":"Guevara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA"}]},{"given":"Sara F.","family":"Steinfeld","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA"}]},{"given":"Raina","family":"Jose","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Bread of Life, Inc., Houston, TX 77002, USA"}]},{"given":"Farrah","family":"Hmaidan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Bread of Life, Inc., Houston, TX 77002, USA"}]},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Simmons","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Bread of Life, Inc., Houston, TX 77002, USA"}]},{"given":"Calvin W.","family":"Wong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA"}]},{"given":"Clara","family":"Smith","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Bread of Life, Inc., Houston, TX 77002, USA"}]},{"given":"Eva","family":"Thibaudeau-Graczyk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Temenos, CDC, Houston, TX 77003, USA"}]},{"given":"Shreela V.","family":"Sharma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Food insecurity is a known health equity threat for formerly chronically homeless populations even after they transition into permanent housing.

The project aimed to increase access to healthy foods, improve nutritional literacy, healthy cooking\/eating practices, and build community\/social connectedness among 140 PSH residents. Validated food-security screening conducted by CHWs identified low or very low food security among 64% of 83 residents who completed the baseline survey, which is similar to rates found in a previous study among formerly homeless populations placed in PSH. Major themes identified through an analysis of resident feedback include (1) lack of needed kitchenware\/appliances for food preparation, (2) knowledge gaps on how to purchase and prepare healthier food, (3) positive perceptions of healthy food options, (4) expanded preferences for healthy, easy-to-prepare foods, (5) regaining cooking skills lost during homelessness, (6) positive experiences participating in group activities, (7) community re-entry, and (8) resident ownership. Preliminary findings suggest the use of a human-centered design methodology for planning and implementing this multi-level CHW intervention helped reduce food insecurity, engaged participants in learning and adopting healthy and safe cooking and eating practices, and fostered social connectedness and feelings of community among formerly chronically homeless PSH residents.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health"]},{"DOI":"10.37539\/231024.2023.64.18.063","title":["THE PLANT THERAPY IN RUSSIA AND ITS TEACHING"],"author":[{"given":"Alexander Leonidovich","family":"Pastushenkov","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Min","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This paper introduces the status of botanical therapy in Russia and its teaching, focusing on the understanding of plant therapies by Russian scholars, the popularity of plant therapy in Russia, the attitude of the government and its related policies towards plant therapies, and the problems, which the plant therapy is faced with in Russia.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Themed collection of papers from Foreign international scientific conference \u00abJoint innovation - joint development\u00bb.

This study aimed to design and develop advanced drug delivery systems composed of poloxamer 407, a non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80), and cyclodextrins (methyl-\u03b2-CD or hydroxy-propyl-\u03b2-CD) for possible brain targeting of ropinirole after nasal administration for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The hybrid systems were formed by the thin-film hydration method, followed by an extensive physicochemical and morphological characterization. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the systems on HEK293 cell lines was also tested. In vitro release and ex vivo mucosal permeation of ropinirole were assessed using Franz cells at 34 \u00b0C and with phosphate buffer solution at pH 5.6 in the donor compartment, simulating the conditions of the nasal cavity. The results indicated that the diffusion-controlled drug release exhibited a progressive increase throughout the experiment, while a proof-of-concept experiment on ex vivo permeation through rabbit nasal mucosa revealed a better performance of the prepared hybrid systems in comparison to ropinirole solution. The encouraging results in drug release and mucosal permeation indicate that these hybrid systems can serve as attractive platforms for effective and targeted nose-to-brain delivery of ropinirole with a possible application in Parkinson\u2019s disease.

What did Darwin and Spencer have to say about music? What role did music play in their evolutionary theories? What were the values and limits of these evolutionist turns of thought, and in what ways have they endured in present-day music research? The book argues for the significance of Victorian music-evolutionism in light of its ties to a recently revitalized subfield of evolutionary musicology. Taking an interdisciplinary approach to music theorizing, Piilonen explores how historical thinkers constructed music in evolutionist terms and argues for an updated understanding of music as an especially fraught area of evolutionary thought. Historical evolutionists such as Darwin and Spencer developed and applied a concept of music that served as a boundary-drawing device, used to trace or obscure the conceptual borders between human and animal. For Darwin, music served as a kind of proto-language common to humans and animals alike. Spencer viewed music as a specifically human stage of evolutionary advance, beyond language acquisition. These competing views established radically different perspectives on the origin and function of music in human cultural expression, while at the same time being mutually constitutive of one another. A groundbreaking contribution to music theory and histories of science, Theorizing Music Evolution turns to the idea of music evolution with an eye toward disrupting and intervening in these questions as they recur in the present.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.32388\/rv73nd","title":["Review of: \"Nanowires\u00a0\u00a0are quasi-one-dimensional materials, \"their two dimensions are on the nanometer scale.\"\u00a0This one-dimensionality confers distinct electrical and optical properties\""],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-5112-0725","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Sara","family":"Berbatov","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p \/>","container-title":["Qeios"]},{"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-3859915\/v1","title":["Nomadic Pastoralism in Western Himalaya: A Journey through History, Politics, Development, and the Fall of Gaddi Pastoralists"],"author":[{"given":"Som Nath","family":"Thakur","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Amity University"}]},{"given":"Simrit","family":"Kahlon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Panjab University"}]},{"given":"Smita","family":"Bhutani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Panjab University"}]},{"given":"Pooja","family":"Sharma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Panjab University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Nomadic pastoralism is an ancient way of life that has been practised for centuries by various tribes and ethnic groups across the world. It is characterized by the movement of herders and their livestock between different regions in search of fresh pastures, water and other resources. Despite its long-standing history, this way of life is now on the brink of extinction in many parts of the world, facing various challenges including modern politics and infrastructural development. One such group of pastoralists that have been affected by these changes are the Gaddi pastoralists of the western Himalayas. The Gaddi tribe is one of the oldest ethnic groups that have lived in this region for hundreds of years, and they have developed their own distinct culture and traditions. They have played a significant role in sustaining the ecosystem of the region by herding sheep and goats, moving between the high-altitude pastures of the middle Himalayas and the Shiwalik ranges of the lower Himalayas. However, the present dynamics have changed the scenario for the Gaddi pastoralists. The growth of physical infrastructure like dams, canals, and roads, and the expansion of social infrastructure like healthcare, education, and banking, as well as the diversification of employment opportunities in the region, has prompted the Gaddi pastoralists to shift away from their traditional profession. Additionally, the politics of the state has also played a significant role in shaping the fate of the Gaddi pastoralists. The policies of the government, along with the influence of powerful interest groups, have led to the restriction of traditional grazing practices, and the Gaddi pastoralists are now facing challenges in their pursuit of maintaining their traditional ways of life. As a result of these challenges, many Gaddi pastoralists are now shifting towards sedentary occupations, leaving behind their traditional profession. Therefore, this research aims to explore the complex history, politics, development and challenges encountered by the Gaddi pastoralists in the pursuit of maintaining their traditional ways of life in an ever-changing world.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192898807.001.0001","title":["The Philosophy of Money and Finance"],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Most people use money almost every day, and financial assets have become so important to us that they determine our fate both as individuals and as societies.

The original chapters in this volume provide a comprehensive introduction to this exciting new field for scholars and the intellectually curious public. The book is divided into four parts: I. Metaphysics, II. Epistemology, III. Ethics, and IV. Political Philosophy. Within each part, questions that are central to the topic are presented and discussed by leading scholars. The chapters are written in a clear and straightforward manner and without presupposition of any background in either philosophy or finance.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780198904120.001.0001","title":["Thomas Hobbes and Political Thought in Ireland c.1660- c.1730"],"author":[{"given":"Matthew","family":"Ward","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Civil Servant in the UK government"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This is a history of political thought in Ireland c.1660\u20131730, told from the perspective of the reception in that country of Thomas Hobbes, the English philosopher. Unlike Hobbes, political thought in Ireland has received little attention from historians: it is sometimes assumed that there is not much of a subject to study. The reception of Hobbes in Ireland forces us to challenge this assumption. To begin with, it highlights the variety and sophistication of political thought in Ireland. In his political thought, Hobbes was preoccupied by sovereignty, which he conceptualized in terms of natural law and made the defining characteristic of the commonwealth, or the \u2018Leviathan\u2019; but he applied his concept of sovereignty to a broad range of political issues. His political thought was also part of a wider philosophical system which comprehended history, theology, natural philosophy, and mathematics. Together, the key figures in the reception of Hobbes in Ireland\u2014Sir William Petty, John Vesey, and Edward Synge\u2014engaged with Hobbes expansively. But the reception of Hobbes in Ireland also tells of the distinctiveness of Ireland as a context of political thought. In England, Hobbes\u2019s concept of sovereignty was reviled for emasculating parliament, the Anglican Church, and the common law. Too compelling to ignore, the \u2018Leviathan\u2019 had to be \u2018tamed\u2019. In Ireland, where these institutions were weaker, the \u2018Leviathan\u2019 could be released. Petty, Vesey, and Synge engaged with Hobbes on issues that were not prioritized by his English readers and were more sympathetic than they to his concept of sovereignty.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.18572\/2071-1166-2024-1-81-84","title":["Discretion in the Activities of Executive Government Authorities as a Form of Implementation of Their Competencies"],"author":[{"given":"Alina V.","family":"Daungli","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Leading Legal Counsel at the City Children\u2019s Clinical Emergency Care Hospital, Postgraduate Student, Lecturer of the Department of Administrative, Financial and Corporate Law of the Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The absence of the term \u201cadministrative discretion\u201d in the domestic legislation is not an obstacle to its broad interpretation by scientists.

For obtaining high-accuracy compliance and motion precision models of multiple-axis flexure hinges, a brief and generalized analytical model is presented by using the finite beam based matrix modeling (FBMM) method. It can be used to quickly obtain the compliance and precision models by just changing the notch contour functions. The comparative results prove the high accuracy and efficiency of the analytical model. For a much fairer comparison of motion precision between flexure hinges, a new precision model is proposed, in which a non-dimension and more intuitive precision matrix is defined. By using the precision model, the comparison of motion precision between multiple-axis HFCFHs and other multiple-axis flexure hinges indicates that asymmetric flexure hinges have higher motion precision, and multiple-axis HFCFHs also have higher motion precision in asymmetric flexure hinges. Based on the design concept of hybrid flexure hinges, eight types of hybrid multiple-axis flexure hinges with much higher performance are designed, enriching the types of multiple-axis flexure hinges and providing more reference for the selection of hinges in spatial compliant mechanisms. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science"]},{"DOI":"10.25009\/uvs.vi16.2937","title":["Insectos comestibles como modelo de negocio sostenible"],"author":[{"given":"Adriana In\u00e9s","family":"Arroyo Marl\u00e9s","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Para alcanzar el Objetivo de Desarrollo sostenible 2 Hambre Cero, la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentaci\u00f3n y la Agricultura (FAO), enfatiza la necesidad de revisar la disminuci\u00f3n acelerada de recursos naturales en la industria agroalimentaria, para alimentar a m\u00e1s de 9.000 millones de personas, en el a\u00f1o 2030.

This leads to changes in behavior, language problems, and a loss of mental abilities. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD, which suggests that they could be used as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We looked at smallRNA sequencing data from the frontal and temporal brain tissue of FTD patients with mutations in the MAPT, GRN, or C9orf72 genes, as well as brain tissue from people without dementia. The objective of this study was to find out what role miR-129-5p plays in FTD. We discovered that miR-129-5p was abundant in neurons, and knocking it out in a neuron-glia mixed culture increased neuroinflammation and was linked to astrocyte activation. When astrocytes without miR-129-5p were cultured with primary neurons, it had a negative effect on synaptic plasticity. Inhibiting miR-129-5p in mice resulted in hippocampus-dependent learning memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. This study emphasizes the role of miR-129-5p in regulating neuronal activity and its potential as a therapeutic target for FTD. The results show that miR-129-5p plays a crucial role in controlling neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity in FTD. The research sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying FTD and reveals potential therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.30935\/ojcmt\/14133","title":["Exploring the relationship between social media use and academic performance"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2585-6174","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Regina G.","family":"Sakhieva","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pedagogy of Higher Education, Kazan (Volga region) Federal University, Kazan, RUSSIA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5799-1269","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Irina N.","family":"Meshkova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Foreign Languages, RUDN University (Peoples\u2019 Friendship University of Russia named after Patrice Lumumba), Moscow, RUSSIA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2758-6972","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vagiz G.","family":"Gimaliev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Foreign Languages \u21162, Chuvash State University, Cheboksary, RUSSIA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8800-4628","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mariya V.","family":"Melnik","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medical and Social Assessment, Emergency, and Ambulatory Practice, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, RUSSIA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6560-2756","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Natalya N.","family":"Shindryaeva","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Nervous Disease, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, RUSSIA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1330-8165","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sergei P.","family":"Zhdanov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Civil Law Disciplines, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Moscow, RUSSIA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Social media platforms have altered how individuals communicate, disseminate information, and interact with their surrounding environment. University students at forefront of embracing technology and digital culture exhibit heightened engagement with social media platforms.

Despite the reported interplay between tumors and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in fostering drug resistance and disease progression, the underlying mechanisms governing these interactions remain elusive. Here, it was found an upregulation of Collagen type V alpha 1 (COL5A1) in TNBC tissues, particularly in chemoresistant samples, correlating with an unfavorable prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that COL5A1 played a pivotal role in fostering cancer growth, metastasis, and doxorubicin (DOX) resistance both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the cytokine IL-6 produced by COL5A1 overexpressing TNBC cells facilitated M2 macrophage polarization. Reciprocally, TGF\u03b2 from M2 macrophages promoted TNBC DOX resistance through mediating the TGF\u03b2\/smad3\/COL5A1 signaling pathway, therefore constituting a feed-back loop between TNBC cells and macrophages. Mechanistically, COL5A1 was found to interact with TGM2, inhibiting its K48-linked ubiquitination-mediated degradation. This led to an enhanced chemoresistance and increased secretion of IL-6. In summary, these findings unveiled that the upregulation of COL5A1 held significant potential in driving TNBC progression and chemoresistance by modulating macrophage polarization. This supports the proposition that targeting COL5A1 could emerge as an effective strategy against TNBC.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.15536\/reducarmais.8.2024.3512","title":["Sofrimento ps\u00edquico entre estudantes: a abordagem dos t\u00e9cnicos e dos docentes em uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o federal de educa\u00e7\u00e3o profissional e tecnol\u00f3gica"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1175-7637","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jonis Manhaes Sales","family":"Felippe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6884-2173","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eliane Antunes Marinho do","family":"Prado","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Este trabalho tem como objetivo investigar de que forma se d\u00e1 a abordagem do sofrimento ps\u00edquico presente entre estudantes no \u00e2mbito do IFFluminense campus Cabo Frio, especialmente no que tange \u00e0 atua\u00e7\u00e3o docente.

Our aim was to elucidate mechanisms behind this increased expression. Most transposons are found within genes and introns, with a large minority being close to genes. This raises the possibility that transcriptional readthrough and intron retention are responsible for age-related changes in transposon expression rather than expression of autonomous transposons.  To test this, we compiled public RNA-seq datasets from aged human fibroblasts, replicative and drug-induced senescence in human cells and RNA-seq from aging mice and senescent mouse cells. Indeed, our reanalysis revealed a correlation between transposons expression, intron retention and transcriptional readthrough across samples and within samples. Both intron retention and readthrough increased with aging or cellular senescence and these transcriptional defects were more pronounced in human samples as compared to those of mice.  In support of a causal connection between readthrough and transposon expression, analysis of models showing induced transcriptional readthrough confirmed that they also show elevated transposon expression. Taken together, our data suggests that elevated transposon reads during aging seen in various RNA-seq dataset are concomitant with multiple transcriptional defects. Intron retention and transcriptional readthrough are the most likely explanation for the expression of transposable elements that lack a functional promoter.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1261\/rna.079911.123","title":["Characterization of tRNA splicing enzymes RNA ligase and tRNA 2\u2019-phosphotransferase from the pathogenic fungi<i>Mucorales<\/i>"],"author":[{"given":"Shreya","family":"Ghosh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Swathi","family":"Dantuluri","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Agata","family":"Jacewicz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ana M","family":"Sanchez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Leonora","family":"Abdullahu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Masad J.","family":"Damha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Beate","family":"Schwer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stewart","family":"Shuman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Fungal Trl1 is an essential trifunctional tRNA splicing enzyme that heals and seals tRNA exons with 2',3'-cyclic-PO<jats:sub>4<\/jats:sub>and 5'-OH ends.

Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of research regarding the prevalence of coral diseases in coral reefs located on the islands. We analyzed the coral reef lesion assemblages at 6 sites within 3 designated zones, namely Tourism, Aquaculture, and Core zones. Our investigation aimed to determine (1) the types, prevalence, and patterns of coral lesions, (2) the correlation between coral cover and lesion prevalence, and (3) the susceptibility of coral taxa to lesions. A significant difference of 80.54% in the total number of coral lesions was observed between the tourism zone (24.34%) and the core zone (10.36%). Fourteen different lesion types were identified; among the non-disease lesions, sediment damage was the most prevalent (9.95%), followed by disease lesions caused by white syndrome (3.7%). A correlation was found between the cover of dominant coral taxa and the prevalence of lesions (disease and non-disease) at all sites. Mean lesion prevalence across all zones ranged from moderate to high categories. These findings present current data on the distribution of coral lesions and their patterns across zones around Karimunjawa Island.

To obtain the global optimal smooth path for mobile robots, a multi-strategy ensemble Harris hawks optimization algorithm (SDHHO) is proposed in this paper. The spiral search strategy is adopted to improve the early update method of the algorithm, which can improve the global exploration ability. To achieve better balance between global exploration and local exploitation, the Sine chaotic map is introduced to the escape energy, replacing random components. Furthermore, an elite differential mutation strategy combined with Gaussian mutation is designed to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optima. We compared the SDHHO algorithm with other classical and novel algorithms on 23 benchmark functions, and the results demonstrated the superiority of SDHHO. The proposed algorithm is applied to the smooth path planning for mobile robots, which is transformed into an optimization problem of control nodes of high-order Bezier curves. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments underscore the proficiency of the proposed method in generating paths characterized by reduced length and enhanced safety and continuity. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Modern Physics C"]},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-51390-3","title":["Modelling electrified railway signalling misoperations during extreme space weather events in the UK"],"author":[{"given":"Cameron J.","family":"Patterson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"James A.","family":"Wild","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ciar\u00e1n D.","family":"Beggan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gemma S.","family":"Richardson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"David H.","family":"Boteler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Space weather has the potential to impact ground-based technologies on Earth, affecting many systems including railway signalling.

Drawing on legal and political philosophy\u2014as well as empirical data and cases studies\u2014the book examines how cooperative relations steeped in honesty and good faith are a necessity for any viable society. This is especially relevant to the police institution because the police are entrusted to promote justice and security. As with other state institutions, the police institution is supposed to be based on legitimacy. Legitimacy is a function of authority, which is grounded in reciprocal public relationships generating rights and duties. Despite the necessity of societal honesty and good faith, the police institution has embraced deception, dishonesty, and bad faith as tools of the trade for providing security. In fact, it seems that providing security is impossible without using deception and dishonesty during interrogations, undercover operations, pretextual detentions, and other common scenarios. The book addresses this puzzle by showing that many of our assumptions about policing and security are unjustified given fundamental norms of political morality regarding fraud, honesty, transparency, and the rule of law. Although there is a time and a place for the police\u2019s use of proactive deception and dishonesty, the book illustrates why the use of such tactics should be much more limited than current practices suggest\u2014especially considering the erosion of public faith in the police institution and the weakening of the police\u2019s legitimacy.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.18572\/2071-1166-2024-1-17-21","title":["Federal State Fire Supervision: Problems of Bringing Individuals to Administrative Liability in View of Legal Amendments"],"author":[{"given":"Vladimir A.","family":"Vinokurov","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Honored Lawyer of the Russian Federation, Professor of the Department of Theory and History of State and Law of the Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education Saint Petersburg State Fire Service University of the Ministry of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters Named after Hero of the Russian Federation, Army General E.N.

This improves our understanding of the possible implications of sea-level rise, accretion and climate change for mosquito control programmes for similar habitats across temperate tidal areas found in Southwest Western Australia. The output of the model indicate that the proportion of the year mosquitoes are active increases. Population abundances of the two <jats:italic>Aedes<\/jats:italic> species increase markedly. The main drivers of changes in mosquito population abundances are increases in the frequency of inundation of the tidal wetland and size of the area inundated, increased minimum water temperature, and decreased daily temperature fluctuations as water depth increases due to sea level changes, particularly under the model with no accretion. The effects on mosquito populations are more marked for RCP 8.5 when compared to RCP 4.5 but were consistent among the three climate change models.

Results: Between February 12, 2021, and December 17, 2021, 1371 admissions met inclusion criteria with 680 assigned to early intervention and 691 to standard diabetes care. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The early intervention group achieved a lower median PDMG of 8.2 mmol\/L (interquartile range [IQR] 6.9-10.0 mmol\/L) compared with 8.6 mmol\/L (IQR 7.2-10.3 mmol\/L) in the control group for an estimated difference of -0.3 mmol\/L (95% confidence interval [95%CI] -0.4 to -0.2 mmol\/L, p&lt;0.0001). The incidence of HAI was lower in the intervention group (77 [11%] vs. 110 [16%]), for an absolute risk difference of -4.6% (95%CI -8.2 to -1.0, p=0.016). Conclusions: In surgical inpatients, early diabetes management intervention with an electronic specialist-led diabetes model of care reduces glucose and HAI.&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s43066-023-00308-1","title":["Diagnostic and prognostic significance of tissue lncRNA HOTAIR and hexokinase 2 mRNA expression in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma"],"author":[{"given":"Ghada","family":"Salah","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Manar","family":"Obada","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dina","family":"Sweed","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ibrahim Abdelkader","family":"Salama","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ashraf","family":"Khalil","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3993-5378","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shimaa","family":"Abdelsattar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, recognized for its aggressive behavior and frequent late-stage diagnosis, imposes significant challenges in early detection and prognosis.

The author gives voice to one minority view according to which the psychological processes at work in the formation of experiential and propositional imagination are those dedicated to perception and language, respectively. He argues that this view forces perception and language to be directly connected in cognitive architecture, and this contravenes our best available cognitive neuroscience on the relationship between perception and language, which says that perception and language are indirectly connected. Using aphantasia, the author also shows that the other way around will not work, i.e., retaining the indirect connection between perception and language by forcing experiential and propositional imagination to now be indirectly connected. He then shows how stipulating an internal structure for experiential and propositional imagination sustains both the indirect connection between perception and language and the direct connection between experiential and propositional imagination.

The levels of LINE-1 analytes in plasma EVs from ostensibly healthy individuals were higher in females than males.

Whole plasma ORF1p levels correlated with EV ORF1p levels, indicating that most of the circulating LINE-1 protein is contained within EVs. EV LINE-1 mRNA levels were elevated in patients with advanced cancer stages and in select patients with squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic tumors compared to adenocarcinomas.

Hence, it is imperative to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of air quality parameters across the Red Sea and identify temporal trends. This study concentrates on utilizing multiple satellite observations to gather diverse meteorological data and vertical tropospheric columns of aerosols and trace gases, encompassing carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). Furthermore, the study employs the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to analyze the backward trajectory of air mass movement, aiding in the identification of significant sources of air pollutants. A principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation is applied to explore the relationship and co-variance between the aerosol index (AI), trace gas concentrations, and meteorological data. The investigation reveals seasonal and regional patterns in the tropospheric columns of trace gases and AI over the Red Sea. The correlation analysis indicates medium-to-low positive correlations (0.2 &lt; r &lt; 0.6) between air pollutants (NO2, SO2, and O3) and meteorological parameters, while negative correlations (\u22120.3 &lt; r &lt; \u22120.7) are observed between O3, aerosol index, and wind speed. The results from the HYSPLIT model unveil long-range trajectory patterns.

The micrographic findings revealed that, the thickness of HiPIMS-grown nano-tendrill layers increased by 83 % (from 274 to 501 nm) for only a 125 K rise in Ts. This result is explained by the fact that higher surface temperatures led to larger helium bubbles which ultimately produce a thicker nanostructured layer.

The main functions of Type 1 ILCs not only include directly killing target cells but also regulating the local immune microenvironment of the liver through the secretion of cytokines. Uncovering the intricate mechanisms by which transcriptional factors regulate and influence the functions of Type 1 ILCs, particularly within the context of liver tumors, presents a significant opportunity to amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapies against liver malignancies. Using Ncr1-drived conditional knockout mouse model, our study reveals the regulatory role of \nPrdm1\n in shaping the composition and maturation of liver Type 1 ILCs. Notably, Prdm1 regulates the ratio between NK cells and ILC1s, promoting a shift in the balance towards the direction of NK cells. Although \nPrdm1\n did not affect the killing function of cNK cells in an \nin vivo\n cytotoxicity model, a significant increase in cancer metastasis was observed in \nPrdm1\n knockout mice. IFN-\u03b3, granzyme B, and perforin secretion decreased significantly in \nPrdm1\n deficient Type 1 ILCs. scRNA sequencing data also provided evidence that Prdm1 sustains functional subsets of liver type 1 ILCs and facilitates communications between Type 1 ILCs and macrophages. The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in liver Type 1 ILCs, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.\n<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1130\/gsab.s.24944829.v3","title":["Supplemental Material: Submarine hydrothermal fluids facilitated the accumulation of cadmium in Lower Cambrian black shales, South China"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3530-8470","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Zhengbing","family":"Zhou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hanjie","family":"Wen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"et","family":"al.","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Data S1-1: Trace element concentrations of Early Cambrian metalliferous units.

While phage PsgM02F produced a morphogenesis yield of 124 virions per host cell, phage PsgM04F produced only 12 virions per host cell, indicating that they replicate well in Psg with a 50 min latency period.

The difference between the mean of iGSR sample and inter-laboratory were compared. The results revealed that SDI values were employed to evaluate SEM\/EDS or ICP-OES performance in both types of iGSR PT programs. The SDI value can be used as a quick estimation before PT operation. The near zero SDI of PT sample indicated that it is eligible for all iGSR types, whereas the SDI above 1 only suggested for qualitative analysis PT.

The performance of a state-based work can be manually controlled via code evaluation or by using a GUI, but it is also possible to automate a performance by playing a routine and using algorithmic decision-making processes, such as those provided by Markov chains.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["SuperCollider for the Creative Musician"]},{"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-23-3017","title":["The impact of circulating tumor cell HOXB13 RNA detection in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4135-2777","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Susan","family":"Halabi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4372-9040","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Siyuan","family":"Guo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1311-5416","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joseph J.","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3514-2976","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David M.","family":"Nanus","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1499-7203","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniel J.","family":"George","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0031-9655","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Emmanuel S.","family":"Antonarakis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7647-0741","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniel Costin.","family":"Danila","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1444-3617","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Russell Zelig.","family":"Szmulewitz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7331-4700","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Donald P.","family":"McDonnell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6553-8053","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John D.","family":"Norris","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7565-8796","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Changxue","family":"Lu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1414-473X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jun","family":"Luo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MARYLAND, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7012-1754","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andrew J.","family":"Armstrong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Purpose. HOXB13 is an androgen receptor (AR) co-regulator specifically expressed in cells of prostatic lineage. We sought to associate circulating tumor cell (CTC) HOXB13 expression with outcomes in men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the multicenter prospective PROPHECY trial of mCRPC men (NCT02269982, n=118) treated with abiraterone\/enzalutamide. CTC detection and HOXB13 complementary DNA (cDNA) expression was measured using a modified Adnatest, grouping patients into 3 categories: CTC 0 (undetectable); CTC+ HOXB13 CTC low (&amp;lt;4 copies) or CTC+ HOXB13 CTC high. The HOXB13 threshold was determined by maximally selected rank statistics for prognostic associations with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results. We included 102 men with sufficient CTC HOXB13 cDNA, identifying 25%, 31%, and 44% of patients who were CTC 0, CTC+ HOXB13 low, and CTC+ HOXB13 high, respectively. Median OS were 25.7, 27.8, and 12.1 months while the median PFS were 9.0, 7.7 and 3.8 months, respectively. In subgroup analysis among men with CellSearch CTCs \u22655 copies\/ml and adjusting for prior abi\/enza treatment and Halabi clinical risk score, the multivariate HR for HOXB13 CTC detection was 2.39 (95% CI 1.06-5.40) for OS and 2.78 (95% CI 1.38-5.59) for PFS, respectively. Low HOXB13 CTC detection was associated with lower CTC PSA, PSMA, AR-FL, and AR-V7 detection, and more liver\/lung metastases (41% vs 25%). Conclusion. Higher CTC HOXB13 expression is associated with AR-dependent biomarkers in CTCs and is adversely prognostic in the context of potent AR inhibition in men with mCRPC.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Clinical Cancer Research"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fenrg.2023.1327136","title":["Biochar addition to compost heat recovery systems improves heat conversion yields"],"author":[{"given":"Alberto","family":"Pivato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rachele","family":"Malesani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stefano","family":"Bocchi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Razieh","family":"Rafieenia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andrea","family":"Schievano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p><jats:bold>Introduction:<\/jats:bold> Compost heat recovery systems (CHRS) represent an emerging technology to recover residual woody biomass from agroforestry and forestry activities and use the heat that is naturally produced during aerobic biodegradation (composting).

As a synthetic opioid, it offers a valuable substitute for morphine and its derivatives in African countries. However, the adverse health effects of tramadol use resulting from illicit trafficking, like those caused by fentanyl and methadone in North America, have not been well-documented in Africa. This scoping review aims to shed light on the nature and scope of the nonmedical use (NMU) of tramadol in Africa and its associated health consequences. To carry out our scoping review, we used Arksey and O\u2019Malley\u2019s (2005) five-step approach for exploratory analysis and followed Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping reviews to ensure systematic and replicable studies. We then searched six databases: Medline, Global Health (EBSCO), Scopus, Web of Science, the African Journals online database, and for grey literature via Google Scholar without any time restriction. The articles were imported into Covidence and reviewed by two independent researchers. Eighty-three studies on NMU of tramadol\u2019s prevalence or health consequences were selected from 532 titles\/abstracts screened, including 60 cross-sectional and six qualitative studies from 10 African countries. Findings from the included studies highlighted five distinct groups significantly affected by the NMU of tramadol. These groups include: 1) young adults\/active populations with varying degrees of prevalence ranging from 1.9% to 77.04%, 2) professionals, where drivers exhibit a relatively high prevalence of tramadol NMU, ranging from 7.2% to 35.1%, and commercial motorcyclists, with a prevalence of 76%, 3) patients, who have a high rate of tramadol NMUs, with prevalence rates ranging from 77.1% to 92%, 4) academics, with a considerable rate of tramadol misuse among substance-using undergraduates (74.2%) and substance-using high school students (83.3%), and 5) other individuals impacted in various ways. The health consequences are classified into four distinct types: intoxication, dependence syndrome, withdrawal syndrome and other symptoms. Despite providing a comprehensive global overview of the phenomenon described in the African literature, this systematic scoping review\u2019s main limitations stem from the relatively limited exploration of various consequences of the NMU of tramadol, notably those of a social and economic nature. Our review shows that tramadol misuse affects diverse populations in Africa. The prevalence of misuse varies within sub-populations, indicating the complexity of the issue. Professional and academic groups have different rates of misuse across regions. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to address unique challenges contributing to tramadol misuse. Future studies should focus on the social and economic costs of abuse on households to better understand the impact on well-being.<\/jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:bold>Systematic review registration:<\/jats:bold> Open Science Framework: <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https:\/\/osf.io\/ykt25\/\" xlink:type=\"simple\">https:\/\/osf.io\/ykt25\/<\/jats:ext-link>.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["PLOS Global Public Health"]},{"DOI":"10.1088\/1402-4896\/ad2041","title":["Computation of reverse neighbourhood degree-based topological indices for the transition metal phthalocyanine polymers (poly-TMPc)"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4356-3802","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"S.

This study investigated the addictive nature of NSSI behaviors and their association with impulsivity and decision-making, aiming to provide evidence-based insights for the development of multiple effective treatment interventions for adolescents with depressive disorders exhibiting addictive characteristics in their NSSI behaviors.\nMethods\n A total of 126 adolescent outpatients and inpatients diagnosed with depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria were selected and categorized into three groups: depression without NSSI (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u200942), depression with NSSI without addictive characteristics (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u200944), and depression with NSSI and addictive characteristics (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u200940). The present study employed the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24), Chinese Revised Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11), Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI), and the Adolescent Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Questionnaire (ANSSIQ). Cognitive decision-making abilities were assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).\nResults\n There were no significant differences observed in blocks 1 and 2 of the IGT among the three groups. However, the depression with NSSI addictive characteristics group exhibited significantly lower net scores in blocks 3, 4, and 5 of the IGT compared to both the depression without NSSI group and the depression with NSSI non-addictive characteristics group. The addictive characteristics of NSSI behaviors were positively correlated with the severity of NSSI behaviors, depression, and cognitive impulsiveness, and negatively correlated with the total net score of the IGT. In the mediation model, depression played a partial mediating role between cognitive impulsiveness and NSSI behavioral addiction characteristics.\nConclusion\n Adolescents with depressive disorders exhibiting addictive NSSI behaviors demonstrate heightened cognitive impulsivity and exhibit poorer decision-making when presented with choices. Timely modulation of depressive symptoms can be effective in reducing the occurrence of the addictive characteristics of NSSI behaviors.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.3390\/electronics13020398","title":["A Repeated Game-Based Distributed Denial of Service Attacks Mitigation Method for Mining Pools"],"author":[{"given":"Xiao","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an 710071, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7385-032X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Zhao","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Guangzhou Institute of Technology, Xidian University, Guangzhou 510555, China"}]},{"given":"Quan","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an 710071, China"}]},{"given":"Yin","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate School of Media and Governance, Reitaku University, Kashiwa 277-8686, Japan"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5227-2241","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuan","family":"Cao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou 213022, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a prevalent issue in the blockchain network layer, causing significant revenue loss for honest mining pools. This paper introduces a novel method, the Repeated Game-based DDoS attack mitigation (RGD), to address this problem. Unlike traditional methods such as game theory and machine learning-based detection, the RGD method can effectively reflect the changes in mining revenue and strategies under different network-strength environments. In particular, we abstract the problem of DDoS mining pool revenue loss into a game revenue model and propose the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) approach to solve the optimal payoffs and pool strategies in various network environments. Furthermore, we address the returns of mining pools in an infinitely repeated game environment using the Two-Stage Repeated Game (TSRG) method, where the strategy varies with different network environments. The Matlab experimental simulation results indicate that as the network environment improves, the optimal mining strategies of mining pools are gradually shifting from honest strategies to launching DDoS attacks against each other. The RGD method can effectively represent the impact of changes in the network environment on the mining pool\u2019s strategy selection and optimal revenue. Consequently, with the changing network environment, the optimal revenue of the mining pool only increases by 10% of the revenue loss during a DDoS attack.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Electronics"]},{"DOI":"10.1130\/b36919.1","title":["Upper crustal seismic velocity structure of the Hayward fault zone, San Francisco Bay, California, USA: Results from the 2016 East Bay Seismic Experiment (EBSI-16)"],"author":[{"given":"Luther","family":"Strayer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"1Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, California State University, East Bay, 25800 Carlos Bee Blvd., Hayward, California 94542, USA"}]},{"given":"Rufus","family":"Catchings","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"2Earthquake Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, P.O.

Upper crustal velocities are highly variable beneath, west, and well east of the Hayward fault. We observe eight notable features, from west to east: (1) Near San Francisco Bay, there is an \u223c2-km-wide structure with high Vp\/Vs ratios (up to 5) and Poisson\u2019s ratios (up to 0.48) extending from the surface to the base of our model, which we suggest the structure is a near-vertical fault that lies along a straight-line projection between the Silver Creek fault to the south and the Point Richmond fault to the north. The structure may be part of an \u223c90-km-long fault along the eastern SF Bay. (2) The western East Bay Plain, the lower lying area between the bay and the hills, includes up to 800 m of low-velocity sediments (Vp \u223c1600\u22123000 m\/s, Vs \u223c500 m\/s to \u223c1000 m\/s), underlain by higher velocity basement rocks (Vp \u223c3000\u22125800 m\/s; Vs \u223c1000\u22121500 m\/s). (3) Between \u223c1 km and 3 km east of the Bay shoreline, sediments thin in a series of steps (likely faults) toward the Hayward fault. (4) Between \u223c3 km west and \u223c1 km east of the Hayward fault (at the East Chabot fault) at depths greater than 1 km, basement Vp (up to 6000 m\/s) and Vs (up to 2800 m\/s) are high, and Vp\/Vs ratios (&amp;lt;2) and Poisson\u2019s ratios (&amp;lt;0.3) are low, suggesting crystalline rocks. Furthermore, a near-vertical zone of low Vp\/Vs ratios and Poisson\u2019s ratios is between near-surface traces of the Hayward and East Chabot faults, likely corresponding to the San Leandro Gabbro of Ponce et al. (2003). (5) Eastward of the East Chabot fault in the upper 1.5 km, basement Vp (\u223c3000 m\/s to \u223c4200 m\/s) and Vs (\u223c1200\u22122000 m\/s) are lower than those west of the fault. (6) In the eastern Hayward\/Oakland Hills, there are zones of laterally varying, high- and low-velocity (Vp \u223c2500\u22123000 m\/s) Jurassic\u2212Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments in the shallow subsurface that likely extend much deeper than imaged. (7) Seismic energy that propagates westward from sources east of the Hayward fault (HF) appear weaker than energy that propagates eastward from sources west of the HF, suggesting that the HF acts as a partial barrier to shallow seismic energy propagation into the more populated eastern SF Bay area. (8) Unlike many fault zones, it appears that the active trace of the Hayward fault (in our study area) is not cored by a prominent, low-velocity zone relative to rocks to the east and west of the active trace. However, the active trace does mark a prominent change from relatively higher velocities to the west and lower velocities to the east.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Geological Society of America Bulletin"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fmolb.2023.1266156","title":["Exploration of the hypoglycemic mechanism of Fuzhuan brick tea based on integrating global metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis"],"author":[{"given":"Xingliang","family":"Xiang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shanqin","family":"You","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhaoxiang","family":"Zeng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jinlin","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yuqi","family":"Lin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yukun","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lijun","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rongzeng","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chengwu","family":"Song","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shuna","family":"Jin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p><jats:bold>Introduction:<\/jats:bold> Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) is a worldwide popular beverage which has the appreciable potential in regulating glycometabolism.

The surfaces of these molds exhibited reversible water contact angles ranging from 4\u00b0 to 151\u00b0 realized through ultraviolet irradiation and heat treatment. The hydrophilicity of the PDMS molds facilitated liquid-phase mass transfer, contributing to the fabrication of complete and defect-free nickel microstructures with high aspect ratios. Subsequently, the hydrophobic PDMS molds reduced the interfacial adhesion between these molds and nickel microstructures, which was beneficial for perfect demolding. Nickel microstructures with an aspect ratio of 10 can be achieved by using the PDMS molds, which significantly enhance the formability of microelectroforming.

The ability of ML algorithms to resolve complex patterns and extract insights from large datasets has solidified its transformative potential in various scientific domains. This paper introduces an innovative application of ML techniques in the domain of radiation dosimetry. Specifically, it shows the applicability of ML in estimating the radiation dose received by occupational workers. This estimation is expressed in terms of personal dose equivalent, and it involves the utilization of thermoluminescence signals emitted by CaSO<jats:sub>4<\/jats:sub>:Dy-based personnel monitoring badges. To estimate personal dose equivalent, three-stage algorithm driven by ML models is proposed. This algorithm systematically identifies the photon energy ranges, calculates the average photon energy, and determines personal dose equivalent. By implementing this approach to the conventional three-element dosimeter, the study overcomes existing limitations and enhances accuracy in dose estimation. The algorithm demonstrates 97.8% classification accuracy in discerning photon energy ranges and achieves a coefficient of determination of 0.988 for estimating average photon energy. Importantly, it also reduces the coefficient of variation of relative deviations by up to 6% for estimated personal dose equivalent, compared to existing algorithms. The study improves accuracy and establishes a new methodology for evaluating radiation exposure to occupational workers using conventional thermoluminescent dosimeter badge.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Machine Learning: Science and Technology"]},{"DOI":"10.1088\/1748-3190\/ad1b2d","title":["Effect of stroke plane inclination on the hovering aerodynamic performance of tandem flapping foils"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1363-4817","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Shubham","family":"Tiwari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sunil","family":"Chandel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The four-winged form of dragonfly and damselfly allows them to fly with great agility and endurance, which are accomplished by independently controlling the kinematics of each wing.

Despite the improvements in the image acquisition techniques or devices, it is still challenging to measure the 3D deformation of materials and structures in the presence of strong, time-varying ambient light and thermal radiation. In this study, we present what we believe to be a novel dual-filtering single-camera stereo-DIC technique for full-field 3D high-temperature deformation measurement, even in the case of extremely intense ambient light and thermal radiation. In contrast to conventional active-imaging stereo-DIC that only suppresses the thermal radiations in the spectral domain, the proposed technique utilized a dual-filtering strategy (i.e., narrow bandpass optical filtering and ultrashort exposing) to suppress the strong ambient light and thermal radiation in both time and spectral domains. Besides, a four-mirror adapter is adopted to realize 3D shape and deformation measurement using a compact single time-gated camera. Experimental verifications, including assessments with laboratory experiments and validations on real thermal deformation tests under transient aerodynamic heating and direct ohmic heating, convincingly demonstrated that the proposed single-camera dual-filtering stereo-DIC method can achieve accurate 3D shape, motion and deformation measurement, even with strong light and thermal radiation from the quartz lamps and the heated sample.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Optics Express"]},{"DOI":"10.1088\/1361-665x\/ad1c3c","title":["4D printed zero Poisson\u2019s ratio metamaterials with vibration isolation properties for magnetic response"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-8021-7326","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hongwei","family":"Yang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shu","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hang","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2603-2065","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Junhui","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jie","family":"Sheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Feng","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chen","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chaoxu","family":"Liang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bin","family":"Xue","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Although mechanical metamaterials possess high specific energy absorption, they suffer from drawbacks such as irreversible deformations and non-adjustable mechanical properties.

Dummy cell signals for EIS can be easily understood and simulated by existing EIS signal analysis software, while dummy cell signals for CV curves have no simulation formula so far. When using dummy cells for CV tests, users can only observe if the CV curves obtained seem to be correct, which impairs the accuracy and efficiency of quality as well as the ability to confirm the functionality of an EC instrument. In this study, we conducted CV signal analyses on five cases of equivalent circuits consisting of multiple resistors and capacitors, with their correctness verified by dummy cell experiments using two different potentiostats. Based on the measured CV signals, we further demonstrated a data process method to evaluate the performance of a potentiostat quantitatively and automatically.

Ongoing professional development for secondary school teachers is essential to keep pace with evolving educational methodologies, technological advancements, and the changing needs of students. Apart from conventional classroom teaching, secondary educators should actively participate in ongoing learning to refine their teaching methodologies, accommodate various learning styles, and incorporate cutting-edge approaches into their lessons.

This involves embracing diverse learning strategies, leveraging contextual professional learning opportunities, and utilizing various resources to stay abreast of the latest educational trends.

However, this seems an ideal situation which is impractical owing to several conditions and constraints that impede the implementation of holistic education. Pedagogical practices initially relied on rote learning and thereafter several reforms in educational policies asserted the importance of nurturing global competency among the learners. However, this shift from rote learning to a more self-directed learning is a challenging transformation which is idealized to a great extent. In this article, we argue that a sudden shift may not be possible, and to realize learner autonomy and their self-directedness, there should be a gradual but steady progress from pedagogy to andragogy and then to heutagogy. Self-directedness and learner-centredness are the crucial aspects of heutagogy. Taking examples from a case study that we conducted with teachers of English from select higher education institutions in India, we analysed the various tenets of heutagogy and its practicality in the Indian context. We investigated how teachers are incorporating aspects of heutagogy in their English classrooms and what major challenges are encountered. Their individual classroom episodes may serve as an initial reservoir of ideas to orient further research in the field. The possibility of embedding the PAH continuum in classrooms is analysed through the lens of socio-constructivist theory. The insights from this study will be valuable for teachers and students who wish to gain a deeper insight into the heutagogical learning paradigm and its integration into language teaching in the classroom. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Higher Education for the Future"]},{"DOI":"10.53477\/2284-9378-23-45","title":["Cold War Geopolitics"],"author":[{"given":"Jeremy","family":"BLACK","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Swiftly following World War Two, the Cold War between a Soviet-led alliance and an American-led one might appear to be a clearcut case of a continuity with Mackinder\u2019s 1904 perspective.

The observed slowdown of the shock wave through applying a non-Boltzmann energy distribution was found to be consistent with the classical shock wave equations when applying the non-Boltzmann heat capacity ratio.

We conducted a phase I\/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of induction DA-EPOCH-R and ixazomib followed by ixazomib maintenance in aggressive MYC-aberrant NHL. For induction, patients received 6 cycles of DA-EPOCH-R with ixazomib administered twice per 21-day cycle; ixazomib maintenance was administered weekly in responders for up to 1 year. Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I and efficacy of DA-EPOCH-R with ixazomib as measured by 12-month PFS rate in phase II. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for response. Median age was 63 years (range 31-77) and 44% had double\/triple hit lymphoma. In phase I, 3mg of ixazomib was established as RP2D. Twenty-nine (76.3%) patients completed 6 cycles of DA-EPOCH-R and 25 (65.8%) underwent dose escalations. The ORR after induction was 97% (95% CI, 81% to 100%) with a CR rate of 69%. At median follow-up of 18.8 months, the 12-month PFS and OS rates were 78% and 86%, respectively. For DHL\/THL vs DEL, 12-month PFS rates were 53% vs 95% and 12-month OS rates were 65% vs 100%, respectively. During induction and maintenance, grade \u22653 toxicities were predominantly hematologic. Twenty-seven (75%) of patients experienced neuropathy, all low-grade except one.

A rising number of people believe that Sustainable Land Management is an essential strategy for enhancing food security. For generations, Ethiopia has been regarded as a hotspot of land degradation, posing a severe threat to agricultural productivity leading to widespread rural poverty. Hence, this study aimed at identifying the determinants of smallholder farmers&amp;rsquo; choice of SLMPs in the West Wollega zone, Oromia region of Ethiopia using the Multivariate Probit (MVP) model. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResults: Results of the MVP model show that the predicted probabilities of adopting organic fertilizer, area closure, soil and water conservation, crop rotation, and compost were 37.2, 35.3, 40.5, 38.3, and 38.5% respectively. The MVP model results also show that the five SLMPs are complementary and the probability that households choose all five SLMPs was 23% which is low. Further, results of the MVP model show that cooperative membership, model farmer contact, farm size, non-farm income, credit, farm experience, perceived soil erosion, social capital, livestock owned, farmland slope, NGO intervention, information access, and training have a significant positive influence while age, family size, and perceived input cost significantly and negatively impacted the choice of SLMPs by households in the study area. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusions: The findings of the study confirm that socioeconomic, household, farm and institutional characteristics of the households have a significant impact on the choices of SLMPs and hence the need to focus on the above-mentioned factors to enhance the choices of SLMPs and reduce land degradation problem in the study area.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative assessment of esophageal function and the risk of developing postoperative GERD in patients undergoing SG. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, including symptom assessment, upper endoscopy, high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM), and 24 h esophageal pH impedance monitoring (MII-pH). A total of 500 obese patients were included, and their data were compared with 25 healthy volunteers. This study revealed that patients without GERD symptoms, normal endoscopy, HRM, and MII-pH were suitable candidates for SG, with low risk of developing postoperative GERD. The addition of fundoplication techniques to SG may be considered in patients with mild reflux or those at risk of developing it.

In particular, the quest for scalable nodes motivated the development of cavity-enhanced spin-photon interfaces with solid-state emitters. An important challenge remains, however, to produce a stable, controllable, spin-dependent photon state, in a deterministic way. Here we use an electrically-contacted pillar-based cavity, embedding a single InGaAs quantum dot, to demonstrate giant polarisation rotations induced on reflected photons by a single electron spin. A complete tomography approach is introduced to extrapolate the output polarisation Stokes vector, conditioned by a specific spin state, in presence of spin and charge fluctuations. We experimentally approach polarisation states conditionally rotated by <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\frac{\\pi }{2}$$<\/jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\">\n                  <mml:mfrac>\n                    <mml:mrow>\n                      <mml:mi>\u03c0<\/mml:mi>\n                    <\/mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:mrow>\n                      <mml:mn>2<\/mml:mn>\n                    <\/mml:mrow>\n                  <\/mml:mfrac>\n                <\/mml:math><\/jats:alternatives><\/jats:inline-formula>, <jats:italic>\u03c0<\/jats:italic>, and <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$-\\frac{\\pi }{2}$$<\/jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\">\n                  <mml:mo>\u2212<\/mml:mo>\n                  <mml:mfrac>\n                    <mml:mrow>\n                      <mml:mi>\u03c0<\/mml:mi>\n                    <\/mml:mrow>\n                    <mml:mrow>\n                      <mml:mn>2<\/mml:mn>\n                    <\/mml:mrow>\n                  <\/mml:mfrac>\n                <\/mml:math><\/jats:alternatives><\/jats:inline-formula> in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere with extrapolated fidelities of (97\u2009\u00b1\u20091)\u2009%, (84\u2009\u00b1\u20097)\u2009%, and (90\u2009\u00b1\u20098)\u2009%, respectively.

Customers can order online and receive their groceries within 15\u00a0min in the best case. The ability to provide short lead times is, therefore, essential. However, the ambitious service promises of quick deliveries further complicate order fulfillment, and many retailers are struggling to achieve profitability. Quick commerce retailers need to establish an efficient network of micro-fulfillment centers (MFCs) in customer proximity, i.e., urban areas, to master these challenges. We address this strategic network problem and formulate it as a location routing problem. This enables us to define the number, location, type, and size of MFCs based on setup, replenishment, order processing, and transportation costs. We solve the problem using a cluster-first-route-second heuristic based on agglomerative clustering to approximate transportation costs. Our numerical experiments show that our heuristic solves the problem effectively and provides efficient decision support for quick commerce retailing. We generate managerial insights by analyzing key aspects of a quick commerce business, such as lead times and problem-specific cost factors. We show, for example, that allowing slightly higher delivery flexibility (e.g., offering extended lead times) enables bundling effects and results in cost savings of 50% or more of fulfillment costs. Furthermore, using multiple small MFCs is more efficient than larger, automated MFCs from a lead time and cost perspective.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Central European Journal of Operations Research"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/horticulturae10010092","title":["Physiological and Productivity Responses in Two Chili Pepper Morphotypes (Capsicum annuum L.) under Different Soil Moisture Contents"],"author":[{"given":"Aurelio","family":"Pedroza-Sandoval","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Unidad Regional Universitaria de Zonas \u00c1ridas, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Chapingo, Km. 40 Carr.

Jalape\u00f1o plants showed more stability in relative water content (RWC), photosynthetic activity (\u00b5mol CO2\/m2\/s), and a relatively low transpiration (mmol H2O\/m2\/s) and stomatal conductance (\u00b5mol H2O\/m2\/s); therefore, it had a higher number of flowers per plant and number of fruits per plant, consequently recording a high fruit production of 3.94 and 2.99 kg\/m2 in OSMC and SSMC, respectively. In contrast, the Chilaca chili showed low stability in water relative content (WRC), photosynthesis, and transpiration, going from OSMC to SSMC, as well as showed a lower yield in SSMC; however, all of that was compensated by its size and weight of the fruit per plant, with a yield of 4.95 kg\/m2 in OSMC.

Issues surrounding gender identity, equity, and sexual orientation also loom large. With the help of technology, more couples, including same-sex couples, are now able to become parents. From same-sex to open and polyamorous marriages, how we define and perceive some of our most important close relationships have changed. The dissolution and reformation of partnerships and families have gained new importance as nontraditional families have become more common. The formation of families through adoption raises questions of identity and successful parenting. Relationships across cultural, racial, religious, and national lines are also more relevant in today\u2019s pluralistic societies. Finally, what types of relationships are considered worthy of scholarly and scientific attention, and the lenses with which to study them, have also evolved.

Hence, in this research work, using a stack-monitoring kit the welding fumes are collected for various heat inputs and characterized to understand the hazardous emission from zinc-coated steel by the Cold Metal Transfer - 400TPSi advanced technique. The experimental work conducted for the heat input of 0.624\u2009kJ\/mm showed superior results for fume formation rate, dust emission rate and emission factor when compared to other heat inputs. In addition, the dust emission rate and fume formation rate increased as the heat input increased. Also, Hazardous gas emissions of CO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>, SO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>, CO, Zinc and the concentration of total dust for the corresponding heat input were found to be within permissible limits. Furthermore, the TEM analysis exhibits that, the particle structure of the fume is agglomerated chains of spherical and faceted morphology.

Stevioside contents were analyzed using HPLC system with C18 column. Methanolic extracts of naturally grown plants, tissue cultured plants and calli were screened using GC-MS and compared.  According to HPLC analysis, leaves of tissue cultured plants contained highest amount of stevioside content (11.462\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 mg\/mL) followed by naturally grown plants and calli. Twenty seven important phytochemicals were identified by GC-MS analysis and out of those fourteen compounds were found to be common in all three samples. Results revealed that in vitro cultures can be used as the better alternative to overcome limitations in conventional propagation and can be used to obtain stevioside and other important phytochemicals instead of natural plants. GC-MS analysis of Stevia extracts revealed the presence of terpenes, fatty acids, aldehydes with biological activities such as antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflamatory, antioxidant, antimalarial and etc. Bioactivity of those phytochemicals showed the possible use of Stevia extracts in pharmaceutical, food and perfume industries.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780197754191.001.0001","title":["Nonideal Theory and Content Externalism"],"author":[{"given":"Jeff","family":"Engelhardt","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Associate Professor of Philosophy, Dickinson College"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This book examines the intersection of systemic oppression and philosophical methodology. Focusing on philosophical theories of mind and language, it makes the case that they tend to be systematically inaccurate because they abstract away from systemic oppression when they model society, but the phenomena they aim to describe, explain, and predict are in fact systematically influenced by oppression. In short, philosophers of mind\/language have tended to think that oppression is either nonexistent or non-systemic, and this has rendered their theories systematically inaccurate. Moreover, it\u2019s plausible that philosophers have tended to be ignorant of systemic oppression as a consequence of how oppression has influenced educational systems, legal systems, dominant ideology, and our language. In order to develop empirically adequate theories of mind and language, then, philosophers need to learn about and take into account systemic oppression and its effects. In addition to arguing for this general methodological point, the book illustrates it and shows the way forward, showing that two influential versions of content externalism are systematically inaccurate because they fail to recognize how oppression influences their explananda and explanantia. The book then introduces modifications that correct the systematic inaccuracies, thus demonstrating how to remedy inaccurate theories and the methodology that led to them. The book concludes with a consideration of how the arguments, conclusions, and modified theories presented in the book bear on philosophical discussions of epistemic injustice and conceptual engineering.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.53660\/prw-1679-3309","title":["A atividade f\u00edsica potencializa a intelig\u00eancia emocional de idosos da regi\u00e3o Sul do Brasil"],"author":[{"given":"Lidiane Isabel","family":"Filippin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rita","family":"Fagundes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Caroline Ferreira","family":"Machado","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Este estudo investigou a associa\u00e7\u00e3o entre a Intelig\u00eancia Emocional (IE) e Atividade F\u00edsica (AF) em Idosos.

It is unknown if the maladaptive plasticity associated with chronic pain, frequently affecting trained musicians, may alter the use-dependent plasticity in the motor cortex. This study investigated the interaction between adaptive and maladaptive plasticity in the motor pathways, in particular how chronic pain influences long-term use-dependent plasticity. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), corticospinal excitability was assessed by measuring the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP), area of the motor map, volume, and center of gravity of the first dorsal interosseous muscle in 19 pain-free musicians, 17 upper limb\/neck pain chronic pain musicians, and 19 pain-free non-musicians as controls. Motor map volume and MEP amplitude were smaller for both pain-free and chronic pain musicians compared to pain-free controls (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.011). No significant differences were found between musicians with and without chronic pain. These findings confirm that long-term musical training can lead to focalized and specialized functional organization of the primary motor cortex. Moreover, the adaptive use-dependent plasticity acquired through fine-motor skill acquisition is not significantly compromised by the maladaptive plasticity typically associated with chronic pain, highlighting the potential of long-term sensorimotor training to counteract the effects of chronic pain in the motor system.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Brain Topography"]},{"DOI":"10.53288\/0386.1.00","title":["Analogical City"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0683-1708","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cameron","family":"McEwan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/049e6bc10","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Northumbria University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In Analogical City, Cameron McEwan argues for architecture\u2019s status as a critical project.

We have identified hemodynamic metrics that revealed profound differences between IVCS patients and Controls, and between RCIV and LCIV in the IVCS patients. Based on these metrics, we propose that non-invasive measurement of shear rate may aid with stratification of patients with moderate compression in which treatment is highly variable. More investigation is needed to assess the prognostic value of shear rate and shear rate ratio as clinical metrics and to understand the mechanisms of thrombus formation in IVCS patients.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology"]},{"DOI":"10.53477\/2284-9378-23-55","title":["Ukraine \u2013 environmental aspects  of humanitarian demining"],"author":[{"given":"Serhiy","family":"OREL","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vadim","family":"DURACH","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In 2021, Ukraine produced such an amount of food that it would have been possible to feed about 400 million people, not counting the population of Ukraine. The strategy for the development of the agricultural sector of Ukraine envisages providing food for 1 billion of the world\u2019s population by 2030. However, the aggression of Russia on February 24, 2022, and the subsequent hostilities led to the contamination of agricultural lands with a significant amount of Explosive Remnants of War (ERW), which requires humanitarian demining. This article is devoted to the review of the humanitarian demining process from the point of view of its impact on the environment and the determination of the main components affecting the production of agricultural products. In the first period of the demining process, there will be a significant decline in the production of agricultural products. This decline will be determined by the reduction in the area of cultivated agricultural land due to the danger of explosion. In the course of the demining and liquidation of ERW, the area of land will increase, as will the volume of production, but the quality of products will decrease due to the presence of heavy metal compounds and explosive residues in it and the deterioration of the quality of the soil itself. Therefore, after the liberation of Ukraine\u2019s territory, contaminated by mines and ERW, taking into account its importance as the world\u2019s granary, the demining time is of great importance and Ukraine will be very grateful for any help that will reduce it.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["BULLETIN OF \"CAROL I\" NATIONAL DEFENCE UNIVERSITY"]},{"DOI":"10.52163\/yhc.v65i1.875","title":["4.

Despite the proposal of five oleosin clades (i.e., U, SL, SH, T, and M) in angiosperms, their evolution in eudicots has not been well-established. In this study, we employed Brassicales, an economically important order of flowering plants possessing the lineage-specific T clade, as an example to address this issue. Three to 10 members were identified from 10 species representing eight plant families, which include Caricaceae, Moringaceae, Akaniaceae, Capparaceae, and Cleomaceae. Evolutionary and reciprocal best hit-based homologous analyses assigned 98 oleosin genes into six clades (i.e., U, SL, SH, M, N, and T) and nine orthogroups (i.e., U1, U2, SL, SH1, SH2, SH3, M, N, and T). The newly identified N clade represents an ancient group that has already appeared in the basal angiosperm Amborella trichopoda, which are constitutively expressed in the tree fruit crop Carica papaya, including pulp and seeds of the fruit. Moreover, similar to Clade N, the previously defined M clade is actually not Lauraceae-specific but an ancient and widely distributed group that diverged before the radiation of angiosperm. Compared with A. trichopoda, lineage-specific expansion of the family in Brassicales was largely contributed by recent whole-genome duplications (WGDs) as well as the ancient \u03b3 event shared by all core eudicots. In contrast to the flower-preferential expression of Clade T, transcript profiling revealed an apparent seed\/embryo\/endosperm-predominant expression pattern of most oleosin genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and C. papaya. Moreover, the structure and expression divergence of paralogous pairs was frequently observed, and a good example is the lineage-specific gain of an intron. These findings provide insights into lineage-specific family evolution in Brassicales, which facilitates further functional studies in nonmodel plants such as C. papaya.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plants"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/plants13020287","title":["In Vitro Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of a Juniperus communis Callus Culture Extract and Matricaria recutita Processing Waste Extract Combination as a Cosmetic Ingredient"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0097-0931","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna","family":"Ramata-Stunda","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Alternative Plants, Ltd., 2 Podraga Str., LV-1007 Riga, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Martins","family":"Boroduskis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Alternative Plants, Ltd., 2 Podraga Str., LV-1007 Riga, Latvia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6147-6585","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Laura","family":"Pastare","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Environmental Solutions, \u201cLidlauks\u201d, Priekuli Parish, LV-4126 Cesis, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Marta","family":"Berga","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Environmental Solutions, \u201cLidlauks\u201d, Priekuli Parish, LV-4126 Cesis, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Liene","family":"Kienkas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Field and Forest, Ltd., 2 Izstades Str., Priekuli Parish, LV-4126 Cesis, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Liene","family":"Patetko","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Biology, University of Lavia, 1 Jelgavas Str., LV-1004 Riga, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Gundars","family":"Skudrins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Environmental Solutions, \u201cLidlauks\u201d, Priekuli Parish, LV-4126 Cesis, Latvia"}]},{"given":"Dace","family":"Reihmane","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Alternative Plants, Ltd., 2 Podraga Str., LV-1007 Riga, Latvia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9070-3479","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ilva","family":"Nakurte","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Environmental Solutions, \u201cLidlauks\u201d, Priekuli Parish, LV-4126 Cesis, Latvia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>For skin health promotion and cosmetic applications, combinations of plant cell extracts are extensively utilized. As most natural ingredient suppliers offer crude extracts from individual plants or specific isolated compounds, the potential interactions between them are assessed in the development phase of cosmetic products. The industry seeks extract combinations that have undergone optimization and scrutiny for their bioactivities. This study presents a combination of two sustainably produced botanical ingredients and outlines their chemical composition, in vitro safety, and bioactivity for skin health enhancement. The amalgamation comprises the extract of Matricaria recutita processing waste and the extract from Juniperus communis callus culture. Chemical analysis revealed distinct compounds within the extracts, and their combination led to a broader array of potentially synergistic compounds.

To examine the association between commonly obtained echocardiographic markers within the first 12 hours of life and eventual treatment of a hsPDA.\n\nMethods. Patients &lt; 32 weeks gestation age had blinded echocardiograms done within the first 12 hours of life as part of research protocols. Subsequent treatment of the PDA was determined by the clinical team independent of echocardiogram results. T-tests and chi-squared tests were done for continuous data and categorical outcomes. A receiver operating curve was created to optimize cut-off values.\n\nResults. Among 199 neonates studied (mean time of echocardiogram 6.7 hours after birth), those needing PDA treatment had higher left ventricular output (LVO), right ventricular output (RVO), and superior vena cava (SVC) flow (p-values 0.007, 0.044, and 0.012 respectively). Cut-offs for predicting PDA treatment were: LVO &gt; 204 ml\/kg\/min (63% sensitivity, 66% specificity), RVO &gt; 221 ml\/kg\/min (sensitivities 70% and 43%) or SVC flow &gt; 99 ml\/kg\/min (specificities 48% and 73%).\n\nConclusions. Preterm neonates with higher markers of cardiac output in the first 12 hours of birth later required PDA treatment. These data are the first to use standard cardiac output measures in the first 12 hours of life to predict the need for future PDA treatment.

We assessed the role of periostin in fibrosis using mdx mice, an established DMD murine model, for which we conducted a thorough examination of periostin expression over a year. RNA and protein levels in diaphragm (DIA) muscles were assessed and complemented by a detailed histological analysis at 5 months of age. In dystrophic DIAs, periostin (Postn) mRNA expression significantly exceeded that seen in wildtype controls at all timepoints analysed, with the highest expression at 5 months of age (p &lt; 0.05). We found Postn to be more consistently highly expressed at the earlier timepoints compared to established markers of fibrosis like transforming growth factor-beta 1 (Tgf-\u03b21) and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf). Immunohistochemistry confirmed a significantly higher periostin protein expression in 5-month-old mdx mice compared to age-matched healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01), coinciding with a significant fibrotic area percentage (p &lt; 0.0001). RT-qPCR also indicated an elevated expression of Tgf-\u03b21, Col1\u03b11 (collagen type 1 alpha 1) and Ctgf in mdx DIAs compared to wild type controls (p &lt; 0.05) at 8- and 12-month timepoints. Accordingly, immunoblot quantification demonstrated elevated periostin (3, 5 and 8 months, p &lt; 0.01) and Tgf-\u03b21 (8 and 12 months, p &lt; 0.001) proteins in the mdx muscle. These findings collectively suggest that periostin expression is a valuable marker of fibrosis in this relevant model of DMD. They also suggest periostin as a potential contributor to fibrosis development, with an early onset of expression, thereby offering the potential for timely therapeutic intervention and its use as a biomarker in muscular dystrophies.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biomedicines"]},{"DOI":"10.34020\/2073-6495-2023-4-164-181","title":["Features of expenditure of local budgets of different types in the Russian Federation."],"author":[{"given":"T.

However, the extraction techniques used were not very efficient in terms of time and energy consumption; additionally, the solvents used for the extraction were harmful for the environment. To improve the environmental impact of the extractions and at the same time increase the extraction yields, several new extraction techniques were developed. Among the most used ones are ultrasound-assisted extraction and microwave-assisted extraction. These extraction techniques increased the yield and selectivity of the extraction in a smaller amount of time with a decrease in energy consumption. Nevertheless, a high volume of organic solvents was still used for the extraction, causing a subsequent environmental problem. Neoteric solvents appeared as green alternatives to organic solvents. Among the neoteric solvents, deep eutectic solvents were evidenced to be one of the best alternatives to organic solvents due to their intrinsic characteristics. These solvents are considered green solvents because they are made up of natural compounds such as sugars, amino acids, and carboxylic acids having low toxicity and high degradability. In addition, they are simple to prepare, with an atomic economy of 100%, with attractive physicochemical properties. Furthermore, the huge number of compounds that can be used to synthesize these solvents make them very useful in the extraction of bioactive compounds since they can be tailored to be selective towards a specific component or class of components. The main aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive review which describes the main properties, characteristics, and production methods of deep eutectic solvents as well as its application to extract from natural sources bioactive compounds with pharmaceutical interest.

Natural and genetically engineered viruses exhibit various antitumor mechanisms. OVs act by direct cytolysis, the potentiation of the immune system through antigen release, and the activation of inflammatory responses or indirectly by interference with different types of elements in the tumor microenvironment, modification of energy metabolism in tumor cells, and antiangiogenic action. The action of OVs is pleiotropic, and they show varied interactions with the host and tumor cells. An important impediment in oncolytic virotherapy is the journey of the virus into the tumor cells and the possibility of its binding to different biological and nonbiological vectors. OVs have been demonstrated to eliminate cancer cells that are resistant to standard treatments in many clinical trials for various cancers (melanoma, lung, and hepatic); however, there are several elements of resistance to the action of viruses per se. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the combination of OVs with other standard treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies, and cellular therapies, to increase the response rate. This review provides a comprehensive update on OVs, their use in oncolytic virotherapy, and the future prospects of this therapy alongside the standard therapies currently used in cancer treatment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Molecular Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.7554\/elife.93079.1","title":["The breath shape controls intonation of mouse vocalizations"],"author":[{"given":"Alastair","family":"MacDonald","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1870-2759","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kevin","family":"Yackle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Intonation in speech is the control of vocal pitch to layer expressive meaning to communication, like increasing pitch to indicate a question.

A basic tone is created by exhalation through a constricted laryngeal voice box, and it is thought that more complex utterances are produced solely by dynamic changes in laryngeal tension. But perhaps, the shifting pitch also results from altering the power of exhalation. Consistent with the latter model, we describe that intonation in many adult murine vocalizations follows deviations in exhalation and that the brainstem vocalization central pattern generator, the iRO, can create this breath pattern. Consequently, ectopic activation of the iRO not only induces phonation, but also the pitch patterns that compose most of the vocalizations in the murine lexicon.

The catalytic domain of HDAC11 shares low sequence identity with other HDAC isoforms which makes the conventional homology modeling less reliable. AlphaFold is a neural network machine learning approach that can predict the 3D structure of proteins with high accuracy even in absence of similar structures. However the fact that AlphaFold models are predicted in absence of small molecules and ions\/cofactors complicate their utilization for drug design. Previously we optimized an HDAC11 AlphaFold model by adding the catalytic zinc ion and minimization in the presence of reported HDAC11 inhibitors. In the current study we implement a comparative structure-based virtual screening approach utilizing the previously optimized HDAC11 AlphaFold model to identify novel and selective HDAC11 inhibitors. The stepwise virtual screening approach was successful in identifying a hit that was subsequently tested using an in vitro enzymatic assay. The hit compound showed an IC50 value of 3.5 \u00b5M for HDAC11 and could selectively inhibit HDAC11 over other HDAC subtypes at 10 \u00b5M concentration. In addition we carried out molecular dynamics simulations to further confirm the binding hypothesis obtained by the docking study.

However, the research on heat dissipation path closely related to SHE remains incomplete. This paper initiates an in-depth analysis of thermal effects involving the fine structures within heat dissipation path, using ultrafast pulse I-V measurements combined with thermal simulations. It is found in practical processes that the SHE of scaled-down devices decreased by 40% rather than increase. Research shows the improvement is attributed to the reduction in thickness of buried oxide (BOX) layer between different generations of processes, and the decrease in thermal sensitivity. Based on the two-stage SHE mechanism, the study clarified for the first time that the box layer mainly affects first-stage heat dissipation, and the main timescale of impact is about the first 100ns. In addition, the heat dissipation capability of contact can effectively affect the temperature rise of first-stage SHE. For the first time, we reveal that the TiN barrier layer with low thermal conductivity is the key factor limiting heat dissipation through contact.

Combination of dry and wet screening was adopted as the method to separate aggregates, and soil organic carbon and aggregate organic carbon content was determined by method of external heating by using potassium dichromate, to analyze the characteristics and variation rules of organic carbon in soil aggregates in 0-30cm soil profile. (1)In general, the SOC content of different land use patterns shows a following trend: farmland\u2009&gt;\u2009vegetable fields\u2009&gt;\u2009economic woodland\u2009&gt;\u2009derelict land. (2) In 0-30cm soil profile, regarding to farmland, soil aggregate content increases as the particle size of soil aggregate decreases. In vegetable fields, the content is maximum when the particle size of aggregate is between 1mm and 2mm. In economic woodland, the content reduces as the particle size decreases. It suggests that the composition proportion of soil aggregate particle size is different greatly under different land use patterns. (3) Under different land use patterns, the SOC content of soil aggregates with different particle sizes also vary. Except farmland, the SOC content of soil aggregates under other land use patterns shows an increasing trend with the decrease of soil aggregate particle size. Under different land use patterns, the SOC content in soil aggregates with different particle sizes is different. The smaller the particle size is, the better the accumulation of SOC is. Soil aggregate organic carbon content is significantly different under different land use patterns. Farmland and vegetable fields are in favor of the accumulation of soil aggregate organic carbon.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1364\/oe.503483","title":["Compact angled multimode interference duplexers for multi-gas sensing applications"],"author":[{"given":"Ajmal","family":"Thottoli","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Politecnico di Bari"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3642-5225","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Artem S.","family":"Vorobev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Politecnico di Bari"},{"name":"Munster Technological University"},{"name":"Tyndall National Institute"}]},{"given":"Gabriele","family":"Biagi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03c44v465","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]},{"name":"Munster Technological University"}]},{"given":"Simone","family":"Iadanza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Munster Technological University"},{"name":"Paul Scherrer Institut"},{"name":"IBM Research Z\u00fcrich"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2603-7648","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marilena","family":"Giglio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03c44v465","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2985-1215","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Giovanni","family":"Magno","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Politecnico di Bari"}]},{"given":"Marco","family":"Grande","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Politecnico di Bari"}]},{"given":"Liam","family":"O\u2019Faolain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Munster Technological University"},{"name":"Tyndall National Institute"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>A compact, low-loss 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091 angled-multi-mode-interference-based duplexer is proposed as an optical component for integrating several wavelengths with high coupling efficiency.

The complexity of the inversion problem and the limited data set make it difficult to ensure the stability and generalization of neural networks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel approach called multi-branch attention U-Net (MAU-Net) for velocity inversion. The key distinction of MAU-Net from previous data-driven approaches lies in its ability to not only learn information from the data domain, but also incorporate prior model domain information. MAU-Net consists of two branches: one branch uses seismic records as input to effectively learn the mapping relationship between the data and model domains, while the other branch employs a prior geological model as input to extract features from the model domain, thereby guiding MAU-Net\u2019s learning process. Additionally, we introduce three major improvements in the model branching path to enhance MAU-Net\u2019s utilization of seismic data and handle redundant information. We validate the effectiveness of each improvement through ablation experiments. The performance of MAU-Net is demonstrated with the Marmousi model and 2004 BP model, and it can also be combined with FWI to further improve the quality of the inversion result. MAU-Net exhibits robust performance on field data through the use of transfer learning techniques, further confirming its reliability and applicability. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["GEOPHYSICS"]},{"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-3806743\/v1","title":["RBM15B Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression via IGF2BP1-Mediated ITSN2 mRNA Stabilization"],"author":[{"given":"Yongfang","family":"Xu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Oncology, Hangzhou Cancer Hospital"}]},{"given":"Mengqi","family":"Xiong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Program in Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine of Zhejiang University"}]},{"given":"Wei","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Chengjie","family":"Yao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Research Center of Diagnosis and Treatment Technology for Hepatocellular Carcinoma of Zhejiang Province"}]},{"given":"Yunhao","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Da","family":"Man","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Xiujin","family":"Ye","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Haiyang","family":"Xie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Changku","family":"Jia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background: N<jats:sup>6<\/jats:sup>-methyladenosine (m<jats:sup>6<\/jats:sup>A), the most abundant form of RNA chemical methylation, is aberrantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it affects multiple biological processes including targeted RNA splicing, transport, degradation, stabilization, and translation.\nMethod: The RNA-binding motif protein 15 B (RBM15B) is a pivotal coordinator of m<jats:sup>6<\/jats:sup>A activation, such as alternative splicing of mRNA.

Existing methods can dramatically improve one of the above performances at the expense of the others. In this work, the multi-zone Taylor expansion method (MZTEM) is proposed to reduce these trade-offs between different key figures of merit. In this method, a metalens is devided into odd ring and even ring regions, then the odd (even) ring metalens focus peak is shifted forward with tailored functions of even (odd) ring region, and finally the arrangement of the meta-units is optimized to get higher efficiency. Based on the MZTEM, an achromatic polarization-insensitive lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) metalens is designed working in the visible from wavelength \u03bb =430 nm to 750 nm, which exhibits a focusing efficiency of 35% - 63% and NA of 0.255.

We conducted a systematic search of four databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration Library, to screen studies that compared the incidence of hip osteoarthritis and pain outcomes in patients with cam and\/or pincer morphology and those without.

Eighteen studies with a pool of 20,316 patients were included. Cam and pincer morphologies were associated with a significant increase in the risk of radiological hip osteoarthritis (OR 2.99, 2.01\u20134.44). When analyzed separately, cam (OR 3.64, 2.13\u20136.22) and pincer (OR 2.02, 1.11\u20133.69) morphologies showed an increased risk of radiological hip osteoarthritis (OR 1.67, 0.85\u20133.29). However, neither cam nor pincer morphology was associated with increased risk of hip pain. No significant differences were observed between cam morphology and HOOS\/HAGOS pain subdomains.

The primary objectives were safety and efficacy, defined as day 30 overall response (OR).

No notable toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity or graft-versus-host disease were observed. The day 30 and day 100 OR rates were 48.6% for both. The 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 68% and 32%, respectively. Patients who achieved OR had higher levels and longer persistence of CAR-NK cells.

In contrast, NK cells from suboptimal CBUs had upregulation of inflammation, hypoxia and cellular stress programs. Finally, using multiple mouse models, we confirmed the superior antitumor activity of CAR\/IL-15 NK cells from optimal CBUs in vivo. These findings uncover new features of CAR-NK cell biology and underscore the importance of donor selection for allogeneic cell therapies.

First, we introduce a nonlinear PP-wave reflection coefficient approximation equation in terms of only P- and S-wave impedances for isotropic elastic media. Then by replacing the isotropic part of R\u00fcger\u2019s equation with this equation, we obtain a new PP-wave reflection coefficient approximation equation called the ASI R\u00fcger equation for VTI media. To invert parameters for VTI media based on the ASI R\u00fcger equation, we adopt the Bayesian generalized linear inversion method, a combination of generalized linear inversion and Bayesian linear inversion, in which the noise and model perturbation are assumed to conform to the zero mean Gaussian distribution. Compared with R\u00fcger\u2019s equation, the ASI R\u00fcger equation lowers the trade-off between the parameters, and reduces the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. The synthetic and field data tests demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for inverting VTI media parameters (the vertical P-wave impedance, the vertical S-wave impedance, Thomsen\u2019s parameters \u03b4 and \u03f5). <\/jats:p>","container-title":["GEOPHYSICS"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fimmu.2024.1334769","title":["Antagonism of regulatory ISGs enhances the anti-melanoma efficacy of STING agonists"],"author":[{"given":"Jessica N.","family":"Filderman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jennifer L.","family":"Taylor","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jianmin","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yali","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Prashant","family":"Singh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mark A.","family":"Ross","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Simon C.","family":"Watkins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ayah","family":"Nedal Al Bzour","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lilit","family":"Karapetyan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pawel","family":"Kalinski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Walter J.","family":"Storkus","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a dsDNA sensor that triggers type I inflammatory responses.

Government institutions such as the NCCE and the ISD faced challenges such as limited funding and support from the government to be able to carry out their tasks.

However, the mechanism of FASN upregulation in prostate cancer remains unclear. Here, we examine &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene CpG methylation pattern by InfiniumEPIC profiling and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple racially diverse primary and metastatic prostate cancer cohorts, comparing with FASN protein expression as measured by digitally quantified IHC assay and reverse phase protein array analysis or &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene expression. We demonstrate that the &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene body is hypomethylated and overexpressed in primary prostate tumors compared with benign tissue, and &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene methylation is significantly inversely correlated with FASN protein or gene expression in both primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Primary prostate tumors with &lt;i&gt;ERG&lt;\/i&gt; gene rearrangement have increased FASN expression and we find evidence of &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; hypomethylation in this context. FASN expression is also significantly increased in prostate tumors from carriers of the germline &lt;i&gt;HOXB13&lt;\/i&gt; G84E mutation compared with matched controls, consistent with a report that HOXB13 may contribute to epigenetic regulation of FASN &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;\/i&gt;.

Their distribution is essential for maximizing the outcomes. Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be used to optimize these therapies. In this regard, this study focuses on creating a parametric model of the human respiratory tract from which synthetic anatomies for particle deposition analysis through CFD simulation could be derived. A baseline geometry up to the fourth generation of bronchioles was extracted from a CT dataset. Radial basis function (RBF) mesh morphing acting on a dedicated tree structure was used to modify this baseline mesh, extracting 1000 synthetic anatomies. A total of 26 geometrical parameters affecting branch lengths, angles, and diameters were controlled. Morphed models underwent CFD simulations to analyze airflow and particle dynamics. Mesh morphing was crucial in generating high-quality computational grids, with 96% of the synthetic database being immediately suitable for accurate CFD simulations. Variations in wall shear stress, particle accretion rate, and turbulent kinetic energy across different anatomies highlighted the impact of the anatomical shape on drug delivery and deposition.

The mechanical properties and grain size characteristics of glacial tills are key factors that influence the initiation and development of these debris flows. In this work, a series of consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial compression tests under different confining pressures were carried out on Zelongnong glacial tills at various relative densities of 9.2%, 49.5%, 69.0% and 88.7%. The grain size distribution change before and after the CU tests was also determined. Results show that the glacial tills at relative densities of 9.2%, 49.5% and 69.0% exhibited a remarkable strain-softening and contractive behaviour during shearing, while those at a relative density of 88.7% presented a dilatant behaviour. As the relative density increased, the shear strength, elastic modulus and shearing friction angle increased, reducing the liquefaction potential. Based on the increasing rate of mechanical resistance with the increasing relative density, a critical value of 69.0% was identified to appreciate the distinct mechanical responses of the specimens. From the grain size distributions before and after CU tests, the content of grains with a diameter larger than 0.85\u00a0mm decreased due to the grain breakage while that of grains smaller than 0.3\u00a0mm increased. The higher the specimen relative density, the larger the grain breakage ratio owing to the increasing friction resistance. This grain breakage in turn causes a downward shift of the critical state line on the plane of void ratio and mean effective stress.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Acta Geotechnica"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25021192","title":["Reanalysis of Trio Whole-Genome Sequencing Data Doubles the Yield in Autism Spectrum Disorder: De Novo Variants Present in Half"],"author":[{"given":"Omri","family":"Bar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"NeurAbilities Healthcare<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Voorhees, NJ 08043, USA"}]},{"given":"Elizabeth","family":"Vahey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"NeurAbilities Healthcare<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Voorhees, NJ 08043, USA"}]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Mintz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"NeurAbilities Healthcare<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Voorhees, NJ 08043, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4442-2937","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Richard E.","family":"Frye","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Autism Discovery and Treatment Foundation, Phoenix, AZ 85050, USA"}]},{"given":"Richard G.","family":"Boles","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"NeurAbilities Healthcare<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Voorhees, NJ 08043, USA"},{"name":"NeuroNeeds<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, Old Lyme, CT 06371, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common condition with lifelong implications.

By targeting several immune checkpoint inhibitors or blockers (e.g., PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4, LAG3, and TIM-3) expressed on the surface of immune cells, several monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies have been developed and already translated clinically. In addition, natural killer cell-based, dendritic cell-based, and CAR T cell therapies have been also shown to be promising and effective immunotherapeutic approaches. In particular, CAR T cell therapy has benefited from advancements in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, allowing the generation of several modified CAR T cells with enhanced antitumor immunity. However, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection could hijack a patient\u2019s immune system by releasing pro-inflammatory interleukins and cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, respectively, which can further promote neutrophil extravasation and the vasodilation of blood vessels. Despite the significant development of advanced immunotherapeutic technologies, after a certain period of treatment, cancer relapses due to the development of resistance to immunotherapy. Resistance may be primary (where tumor cells do not respond to the treatment), or secondary or acquired immune resistance (where tumor cells develop resistance gradually to ICIs therapy). In this context, this review aims to address the existing immunotherapeutic technologies against cancer and the resistance mechanisms against immunotherapeutic drugs, and explain the impact of COVID-19 on cancer treatment. In addition, we will discuss what will be the future implementation of these strategies against cancer drug resistance. Finally, we will emphasize the practical steps to lay the groundwork for enlightened policy for intervention and resource allocation to care for cancer patients.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biomedicines"]},{"DOI":"10.1108\/oxan-es284656","title":["Congo\u2019s M23 crisis may reintensify"],"abstract":"<jats:sec sec-type=\"headline\">\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Headline<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>CONGO-KINSHASA: M23 crisis may reintensify<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Emerald Expert Briefings"]},{"DOI":"10.1126\/science.adn1886","title":["Surpassing sensitivity limits in liquid biopsy"],"author":[{"given":"Tina","family":"Moser","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Human Genetics, Diagnostic and Research Center for Molecular BioMedicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."},{"name":"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Liquid Biopsies for Early Detection of Cancer, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."}]},{"given":"Ellen","family":"Heitzer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Human Genetics, Diagnostic and Research Center for Molecular BioMedicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."},{"name":"Christian Doppler Laboratory for Liquid Biopsies for Early Detection of Cancer, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria."}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Attenuation of cell-free DNA clearance in vivo is an alternative strategy to maximize recovery<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Science"]},{"DOI":"10.1073\/pnas.2316477121","title":["Unveiling the effect of Ni on the formation and structure of Earth\u2019s inner core"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4344-2920","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yang","family":"Sun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China"},{"name":"Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027"},{"name":"Department of Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1841-1073","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mikhail I.","family":"Mendelev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011"}]},{"given":"Feng","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011"}]},{"given":"Xun","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Basic Research on Materials, National Institute for Materials Science, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan"}]},{"given":"Bo","family":"Da","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Basic Research on Materials, National Institute for Materials Science, Ibaraki 305-0044, Japan"}]},{"given":"Cai-Zhuang","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5663-9426","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Renata M.","family":"Wentzcovitch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027"},{"name":"Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027"},{"name":"Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, Palisades, NY 10964"},{"name":"Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027"},{"name":"Center for Computational Quantum Physics, Flatiron Institute, New York, NY 10010"}]},{"given":"Kai-Ming","family":"Ho","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Ni is the second most abundant element in the Earth\u2019s core.

Larger animals exhibit fewer tumors compared to smaller ones, though exceptions exist. Mice are more susceptible to cancer than humans, while elephants and whales demonstrate significantly lower cancer prevalence rates than humans. How nature and evolution have addressed the issue of cancer in the animal kingdom remains largely unexplored. In the field of medicine, much attention has been devoted to cancer-predisposing genes, as they offer avenues for intervention, including blocking, downregulating, early diagnosis, and targeted treatment. Predisposing genes also tend to manifest clinically earlier and more aggressively, making them easier to identify. However, despite significant strides in modern medicine, the role of protective genes lags behind. Identifying genes with a mild predisposing effect poses a significant challenge. Consequently, comprehending the protective function conferred by genes becomes even more elusive, and their very existence is subject to questioning. While the role of variable expressivity and penetrance defects of the same variant in a family is well-documented for many hereditary cancer syndromes, attempts to delineate the function of protective\/modifier alleles have been restricted to a few instances. In this review, we endeavor to elucidate the role of protective genes observed in the animal kingdom, within certain genetic syndromes that appear to act as cancer-resistant\/repressor alleles. Additionally, we explore the role of protective alleles in conditions predisposing to cancer. The ultimate goal is to discern why individuals, like Winston Churchill, managed to live up to 91 years of age, despite engaging in minimal physical activity, consuming large quantities of alcohol daily, and not abstaining from smoking.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Genes"]},{"DOI":"10.1088\/1361-6463\/ad2009","title":["Stabilization and Helicity Control of Hybrid Magnetic Skyrmion"],"author":[{"given":"Akhir P.M.","family":"Muzakkiy","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-9536-794X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Edi","family":"Suprayoga","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2068-9613","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adam Badra","family":"Cahaya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The hybrid skyrmion, a type of magnetic skyrmion with intermediate helicity between Bloch and N'eel skyrmion, has gained more attraction.

Defective angiogenesis such as distended vascular sprouts were found in neural tissues and embryonic megakaryocytes were abnormally accumulated in the perineural vascular plexus in mutant mouse embryos.

Uncertainties in power systems can arise from various sources and can have significant implications for grid reliability, stability, and economic efficiency. Australia, susceptible to extreme weather such as wildfires and heavy rainfall, faces vulnerabilities in its power network assets. The decentralized distribution of population centers poses economic challenges in supplying power to remote areas, which is a crucial consideration for the emerging technologies emphasized in this paper. In addition, the evolution of modern power grids, facilitated by deploying the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), has also brought new challenges to the system due to the risk of cyber-attacks via communication links. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive review and analysis of uncertainties in modern power systems, encompassing uncertainties related to weather events, cyber-attacks, and asset management, as well as the advantages and limitations of various mitigation approaches. To fill this void, this review covers a broad spectrum of uncertainties considering their impacts on the power system and explores conventional robust control as well as modern probabilistic and data-driven approaches for modeling and correlating the uncertainty events to the state of the grid for optimal decision making. This article also investigates the development of robust and scenario-based operations, control technologies for microgrids (MGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), and demand-side frequency control ancillary service (D-FCAS) and reserve provision for frequency regulation to ensure a design of uncertainty-tolerance power system. This review delves into the trade-offs linked with the implementation of mitigation strategies, such as reliability, computational speed, and economic efficiency.

With almost 7 million case fatalities of COVID-19 globally, the catalog of FDA-approved antiviral therapeutics is limited compared to other medications, such as antibiotics. All-trans retinoic acid (RA), or activated vitamin A, has been studied as a potential therapeutic against coronavirus infection because of its antiviral properties. Due to its impact on different signaling pathways, RA\u2019s mechanism of action during coronavirus infection has not been thoroughly described. To determine RA\u2019s mechanism of action, we examined its effect against a mouse coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV). We demonstrated that RA significantly decreased viral titers in infected mouse L929 fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages. The reduced viral titers were associated with a corresponding decrease in MHV nucleocapsid protein expression. Using interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) knockout RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrated that RA-induced suppression of MHV required IRF3 activity. RNA-seq analysis of wildtype and IRF3 knockout RAW cells showed that RA upregulated calcium\/calmodulin (CaM) signaling proteins, such as CaM kinase kinase 1 (CaMKK1). When treated with a CaMKK inhibitor, RA was unable to upregulate IRF activation during MHV infection. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RA-induced protection against coronavirus infection depends on IRF3 and CaMKK.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Viruses"]},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-51903-0","title":["Exploring potential causal associations between autoimmune diseases and colorectal cancer using bidirectional Mendelian randomization"],"author":[{"given":"Lu","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Feifan","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hua","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Baoshan","family":"Cao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Several observational studies have revealed an association between autoimmune diseases (AIDs) and colorectal cancer (CRC), although their causal association remained controversial. Therefore, our study used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to verify the causal association between AIDs and CRC. We employed three common MR approaches, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, to assess the causal association between type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, celiac disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and CRC. The reverse MR analysis was performed to assess the possibility of reverse causation. To evaluate the validity of the analysis, we also performed sensitivity analysis, such as the heterogeneity test, the horizontal pleiotropy test, and the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, and validated the results in the validation cohort. Our results showed that genetically predicted T1D was nominally associated with a lower risk of CRC (IVW OR\u2009=\u20090.965, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.939\u20130.992, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.012). However, genetic susceptibility to psoriasis nominally increased the risk of CRC (IVW OR\u2009=\u20091.026, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.002\u20131.050, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.037). Genetically predicted PSC had a significant causal effect on the increasing risk of CRC (IVW OR\u2009=\u20091.038, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.016\u20131.060, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20095.85\u2009\u00d7\u200910<jats:sup>\u22124<\/jats:sup>). Furthermore, the MR analysis between PSC and the CRC validation cohort indicated consistent results. We found no causal association between genetically predicted other five AIDs and CRC (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009&gt;\u20090.05). The results of reverse MR analysis showed that genetically predicted CRC had no causal effect on T1D, psoriasis, and PSC (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009&gt;\u20090.05). The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results of the MR analysis were reliable.

In this study, we proposed a vaccine model of a restructured \u201chead-to-tail\u201d dimer to efficiently stimulate B cell response. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using this model to develop a paramyxovirus vaccine through a low-cost rice endosperm expression system. Crystal structure and small-angle X-ray scattering data showed that the restructured hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN) formed tetramers with fully exposed quadruple receptor binding domains and neutralizing epitopes. In comparison with the original HN antigen and three traditional commercial whole virus vaccines, the restructured HN facilitated critical epitope exposure and initiated a faster and more potent immune response. Two-dose immunization with 0.5 \u03bcg of the restructured antigen (equivalent to one-127th of a rice grain) and one-dose with 5 \u03bcg completely protected chickens against a lethal challenge of the virus. These results demonstrate that the restructured HN from transgenic rice seeds is safe, effective, low-dose useful, and inexpensive.

However, the relationships between poverty eradication and the other SDGs remain unclear, and thus current knowledge is insufficient to support the synergized achievement of the SDGs. China eliminated extreme poverty in 2021, and thus in this study, we analyzed the variations in sustainability and equality related to the environment and the provision of public services in China during the poverty eradication program from 2010 to 2020. We combined statistical data, point of interest data, and environmental monitoring and remote sensing data to evaluate progress in China\u2019s 832 poverty-stricken counties. The results showed that the mean values of environmental and public service sustainability indicators improved from 2010 to 2020. In addition, the mean Theil index value decreased from 0.46 to 0.35 during this period, implying a reduction in inequality. Inequality between poverty-stricken and non-poverty-stricken areas accounted for 9.3% of overall inequality among the counties in 2010, and this had decreased to 7.7% in 2020. However, unbalanced regional investment resulted in increased gaps between poverty-stricken and non-poverty-stricken counties in relation to education and health care. Overall, 15% of the population and 54.8% of the land area in poverty-stricken counties experienced both a loss of their advantage in terms of environmental quality compared with non-poverty-stricken counties and greater lags in the provision of public services. Linear estimation showed that investment in poverty-stricken counties should be increased by 226.2 and 72.0% in relation to education and health care, respectively, to eliminate these inequalities.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Humanities and Social Sciences Communications"]},{"DOI":"10.1158\/2767-9764.25020891.v1","title":["FIGURE 3 from &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; Gene Methylation is Associated with Fatty Acid Synthase Expression and Clinical-genomic Features of Prostate Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0004-8362-8430","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Oluwademilade","family":"Dairo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-5274-8453","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lia","family":"DePaula Oliveira","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3348-6321","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ethan","family":"Schaffer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7268-4494","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thiago","family":"Vidotto","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8771-7001","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adrianna A.","family":"Mendes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5592-6658","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jiayun","family":"Lu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-6961-9272","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sophie Vo","family":"Huynh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7885-3319","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jessica","family":"Hicks","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2760-1853","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adam G.","family":"Sowalsky","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4847-5307","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Angelo M.","family":"De Marzo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5100-172X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Corrine E.","family":"Joshu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4580-649X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Brian","family":"Hanratty","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7015-3059","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Karen S.","family":"Sfanos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6599-6775","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"William B.","family":"Isaacs","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0809-6425","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael C.","family":"Haffner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0494-9067","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tamara L.","family":"Lotan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;FASN protein expression in tumor glands is inversely correlated with &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene methylation in tumor tissue in metastatic CRPC cohort. &lt;b&gt;A,&lt;\/b&gt; Representative plots of CpG methylation level in &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; by WGBS with corresponding FASN mRNA expression (TPM) for three representative tumors with low (blue) and high (red) FASN gene expression in the SU2C WCDT cohort.

improvements over the past few decades. One of the most important innovative breakthroughs in modern medicine is the advent of minimally and less invasive treatments. The trend towards employing less invasive treatment has been vividly shown in the field of gastroenterology, particularly coloproctology. Parallel to foregut interventions, colorectal surgery has shifted towards a minimally invasive approach. Coloproctology, including both medical and surgical management of colorectal diseases, has undergone a remarkable paradigm shift. The treatment of both benign and malignant colorectal conditions has gradually transitioned towards more conservative and less invasive approaches. An interesting paradigm shift was the trend to avoid the need for radical resection of rectal cancer altogether in patients who showed complete response to neoadjuvant treatment. The trend of adopting less invasive approaches to treat various colorectal conditions does not seem to be stopping soon as further research on novel, more effective and safer methods is ongoing.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["World Journal of Gastroenterology"]},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s10668-023-04399-z","title":["Analysing the nexus between clean energy expansion, natural resource extraction, and load capacity factor in China: a step towards achieving COP27 targets"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6459-9898","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ojonugwa","family":"Usman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Oktay","family":"Ozkan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ibrahim","family":"Adeshola","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Babatunde Sunday","family":"Eweade","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The excessive use of non-renewable energy in 21st-century economic growth has continued to hurt the environment by accumulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. However, promoting environmental sustainability requires expanding clean energy\u00a0utilisation. In this study, we examine the effects of clean energy expansion and natural resource extraction on load capacity factor (LCF) in China from 1970 to 2018. Using the dynamic autoregressive distributed lag simulations approach, we extend the standard load capacity curve (LCC) hypothesis by incorporating clean energy expansion and natural resource extraction as main determinants of the LCF. The empirical\u00a0outcomes reveal that economic expansion is, although positively associated with the LCF, but its squared term degrades the LCF. This confirms that the LCC hypothesis is not valid for China. Moreover, while clean energy expansion has a positive effect on the LCF, the effect of natural resource extraction is negative. These effects are stronger and statistically significant only in the long run. Therefore, this study highlights the potentials for a sustainable decarbonized economy in China by investing not only in clean energy sources but also efficiently use the available natural resources in the country.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Environment, Development and Sustainability"]},{"DOI":"10.26434\/chemrxiv-2024-7gb3v","title":["Nickel Perfluoroalkyl Complexes Supported by Simple Acetate Co-Ligands"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-5909-5878","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cherry","family":"Ravidas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Lehigh University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4224-7461","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Scott","family":"Shreiber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lehigh University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4990-0355","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David","family":"Vicic","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lehigh University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The interaction of tetramethylammonium acetate with [(MeCN)2Ni(CF3)2], [(MeCN)2Ni(C2F5)2], and [NMe4][(MeCN)Ni(CF3)3] was explored by 19F NMR spectroscopy.

The general outline of this pathway is understood, however the specific mechanisms are still unclear. In the last 15 years there have been vast advancements in technology that enable us to advance our understanding of this complex and subtle pathway. Therefore, based on the strong foundation of work performed over the last 40\u00a0years, we can now build another level of understanding, using the new technologies available. The biosynthetic secretory pathway is a high precision process, that involves a number of tightly regulated steps: Protein folding and quality control, cargo selection for Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) exit, Golgi trafficking, sorting and secretion. When deregulated it causes severe diseases that here we categorise into three main groups of aberrant secretion: decreased, excess and altered secretion. Each of these categories disrupts organ homeostasis differently, effecting extracellular matrix composition, changing signalling events, or damaging the secretory cells due to aberrant intracellular accumulation of secretory proteins. Diseases of aberrant secretion are very common, but despite this, there are few effective therapies. Here we describe ER exit sites (ERES) as key hubs for regulation of the secretory pathway, protein quality control and an integratory hub for signalling within the cell. This review also describes the challenges that will be faced in developing effective therapies, due to the specificity required of potential drug candidates and the crucial need to respect the fine equilibrium of the pathway. The development of novel tools is moving forward, and we can also use these tools to build our understanding of the acute regulation of ERES and protein trafficking.

This work presents a hybrid method that is inspired by all four categories and has interesting scalability properties. A neural cellular automaton is trained to evolve microstructures based on local information. Unlike most machine learning-based approaches, it does not directly require a data set of reference micrographs, but is trained from statistical microstructure descriptors that can stem from a single reference. This means that the training cost scales only with the complexity of the structure and associated descriptors. Since the size of the reconstructed structures can be set during inference, even extremely large structures can be efficiently generated. Similarly, the method is very efficient if many structures are to be reconstructed from the same descriptor for statistical evaluations.

The results remain robust when applying pooled OLS and fixed effect OLS techniques for control.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings<\/jats:title><jats:p>The study's findings reveal that economic performance, specifically economic growth, plays a pivotal role in the sustained dominance of the JDP\/AKP party. Voters closely associate JDP preference with economic growth, resulting in higher voting shares during periods of economic prosperity. Along with economic growth; share of agriculture in regions' GDP, female illiteracy rate, old population rate, net domestic migration, terrorism and party alignment are also influential factors in the Turkish case. Furthermore, differences among sociocultural groups, and East\u2013West dichotomy seem to be important factors that reveal the impact of social cleavages to understand electoral choice in Turkey.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality\/value<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study contributes to the existing literature by offering a comprehensive multidimensional analysis of electoral behavior in Turkey, focusing on the JDP\/AKP dominance period. The main contribution of this study is its multidimensional perspective on the power bases of all main parties, considering key voter choice theories (cleavages, party alignment and retrospective economic performance voting) that have not been systematically analyzed in prior research. The main research question of this study is to examine which factors affect voting behavior in Turkey and how the dynamics of center-periphery or eastern-western region voting behavior under the JDP hegemony can be explained. The contribution of this study consists not only in its empirical testing of panel data approaches but also in its comprehensive analysis of four major political parties. Building upon existing studies in the literature, this research seeks to extend the understanding of voting dynamics for the four main parties in the parliament \u2014 JDP\/AKP, RPP\/CHP, NMP\/MHP and PPDP\/HDP \u2014 by delving into their dynamics individually, thereby expanding the scope of previous studies. This study aims to make a contribution by not only empirically testing panel data approaches but also conducting a comprehensive analysis of four major political parties. Furthermore, the separate inclusion of the 2015 elections and utilization of a panel data approach enrich the analysis by capturing the evolving dynamics of Turkish voting behavior. The study underscores the significance of socioeconomic factors, economic performance and social cleavages for voters' choices within the context of a dominant party rule.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Review of Economics and Political Science"]},{"DOI":"10.1158\/2767-9764.25020882.v1","title":["FIGURE 6 from &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; Gene Methylation is Associated with Fatty Acid Synthase Expression and Clinical-genomic Features of Prostate Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0004-8362-8430","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Oluwademilade","family":"Dairo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-5274-8453","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lia","family":"DePaula Oliveira","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3348-6321","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ethan","family":"Schaffer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7268-4494","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thiago","family":"Vidotto","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8771-7001","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adrianna A.","family":"Mendes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5592-6658","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jiayun","family":"Lu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-6961-9272","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sophie Vo","family":"Huynh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7885-3319","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jessica","family":"Hicks","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2760-1853","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adam G.","family":"Sowalsky","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4847-5307","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Angelo M.","family":"De Marzo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5100-172X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Corrine E.","family":"Joshu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4580-649X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Brian","family":"Hanratty","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7015-3059","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Karen S.","family":"Sfanos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6599-6775","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"William B.","family":"Isaacs","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0809-6425","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael C.","family":"Haffner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0494-9067","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tamara L.","family":"Lotan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Neither FASN protein, nor &lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene methylation are associated with self-identified race. &lt;b&gt;A,&lt;\/b&gt; FASN protein expression by race in JHU primary tumor cohort. &lt;b&gt;B,&lt;\/b&gt; FASN protein expression by race in PCBN primary tumor cohort. &lt;b&gt;C,&lt;\/b&gt; FASN protein expression by race in TCGA primary tumor cohort. &lt;b&gt;D,&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene expression by race in TCGA primary tumor cohort. &lt;b&gt;E,&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene methylation mean beta value by self-identified race in JHU primary tumor cohort. &lt;b&gt;F,&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FASN&lt;\/i&gt; gene methylation mean beta value by self-identified race in TCGA primary tumor cohort (*, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;\/i&gt; &lt; 0.05).&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s11886-023-02019-w","title":["Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) from an Interventionalist Perspective"],"author":[{"given":"Nichole","family":"Brunton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Patricia J.

removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via autophagy is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. This event is initiated by the translocation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin to damaged mitochondria, and it requires the Serine\/Threonine-protein kinase PINK1. In a coordinated set of events, PINK1 operates upstream of Parkin in a linear pathway that leads to the phosphorylation of Parkin, Ubiquitin, and Parkin mitochondrial substrates, to promote ubiquitination of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins. Ubiquitin-decorated mitochondria are selectively recruiting autophagy receptors, which are required to terminate the organelle via autophagy. In this work, we show a previously uncharacterized molecular pathway that correlates the activation of the Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>-dependent phosphatase Calcineurin to Parkin translocation and Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Calcineurin downregulation or genetic inhibition prevents Parkin translocation to CCCP-treated mitochondria and impairs stress-induced mitophagy, whereas Calcineurin activation promotes Parkin mitochondrial recruitment and basal mitophagy. Calcineurin interacts with Parkin, and promotes Parkin translocation in the absence of PINK1, but requires PINK1 expression to execute mitophagy in MEF cells. Genetic activation of Calcineurin in vivo boosts basal mitophagy in neurons and corrects locomotor dysfunction and mitochondrial respiratory defects of a <jats:italic>Drosophila<\/jats:italic> model of impaired mitochondrial functions.

A quota sample representing three regions of Vietnam, including 702 customers who already own personal cars, is collected. Structural equation modelling is used to test the research hypotheses. The results confirm that the COB image has a positive effect on perceived CSR. Corporate reputation plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between COB image and perceived CSR, while COM image only plays an important role as an independent variable. In addition, the study also confirmed the importance of perceived CSR on customer trust and loyalty.

In the previous WHO classification, squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid was defined as a carcinoma composed entirely of squamous cells without differentiated carcinoma components. It was once included in the WHO tumor classification separately. However, the 2022 WHO classification of squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid was reclassified as a morphologic subtype of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). The squamous cell carcinoma pattern is similar to the other histologic types of ATC, but the phenotype associated has a poorer prognosis. The typical clinical manifestation of this condition is a cervical mass, accompanied by indications and symptoms of compression on adjacent structures such as the esophagus and trachea in advanced stages. Secondary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid may occur due to the spread of squamous carcinoma of the larynx or esophagus or distant metastases from other sites. Diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid includes neck Ultrasound (US), Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), puncture tissue biopsy, and full endoscopy to identify metastatic lesions from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, esophagus, or bronchi and to help with the initial staging of the tumor. Current treatment modalities include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination. Because of the poor prognosis of patients with this disease, the short survival period, usually less than one year, and the difficulty of preoperative diagnosis, this article reviews the epidemiological features, origin, clinical features, pathological features, and differential diagnosis to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this disease by clinicians.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Endocrinology"]},{"DOI":"10.1152\/ajprenal.00347.2023","title":["Guidelines on Antibody Use for Physiology Research"],"author":[{"given":"Heddwen L.","family":"Brooks","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, United States"}]},{"given":"Lisandra E.","family":"de Castro Br\u00e1s","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC - North Carolina, United States"}]},{"given":"Keith R.","family":"Brunt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Saint John, NB, Canada"}]},{"given":"Megan A.","family":"Sylvester","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States"}]},{"given":"Michelle S.","family":"Parvatiyar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nutrition and Integrative Physiology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States"}]},{"given":"Padmini","family":"Sirish","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States"}]},{"given":"Shyam S.","family":"Bansal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Heart and Vascular Institute, Department of Cellular & Molecular Physiology, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA, United States"}]},{"given":"Rasheed","family":"Sule","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States"}]},{"given":"Ashley L.","family":"Eadie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University, Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada"}]},{"given":"Mark A.","family":"Knepper","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States"}]},{"given":"Robert A.","family":"Fenton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"}]},{"given":"Merry L.","family":"Lindsey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Graduate Studies, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, United States"}]},{"given":"Kristine Y.","family":"DeLeon-Pennell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States"}]},{"given":"Aldrin V.","family":"Gomes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Antibodies are one of the most used reagents in scientific laboratories and are critical components for a multitude of experiments in physiology research.

Although thermoelectric efficiency can be significantly enhanced through post-treatment doping, these processes often involve environmentally harmful organic solvents or reagents. In this study, a novel and environmentally benign method using purified water (including room temperature water and subsequent warm water) to treat PEDOT:PSS film has been developed, resulting in improved thermoelectric performance. The morphology data, chemical composition, molecular structure, and thermoelectric performance of the films before and after treatment were characterized and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectrum, XRD pattern, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and a thin film thermoelectric measurement system. The results demonstrate that the water treatment effectively removes nonconductive PSS from PEDOT:PSS composites, significantly enhancing their conductivity. Treated films exhibit improved thermoelectric properties, particularly those treated only 15 times with room temperature water, achieving a high electrical conductivity of 62.91 S\/cm, a Seebeck coefficient of 14.53 \u03bcV K\u22121, and an optimal power factor of 1.3282 \u00b5W\u00b7m\u20131\u00b7K\u20132.

Historical simulations of 19 CMIP6 GCMs are meticulously compared with ERA5 data for 1986\u20132014. The bilinear interpolation technique is used to harmonize the resolution of GCM data with the observed grid points. Seven distinct error metrics quantify the grid-to-grid agreement between GCMs and ERA5 data. The metrics are integrated into the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for seasonal and annual rankings of GCMs. Finally, the ensemble means of top-performing models are estimated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Arithmetic Mean (AM) for relative comparison. The outcomes of this study underscore the variability in GCM performance across different seasons, necessitating the development of an overarching ranking system. Results reveal ACCESS.CM2 is the preeminent GCM for rainfall, while INM.CM4.8 excels in replicating Tmax and UKESM1.0.LL in replicating Tmin. In contrast, FGOALS.g3, KACE.1.0.G and CanESM5 are the most underperformed models in estimating rainfall, Tmx and Tmn, respectively.

However, its short duration of response and emergence of resistance are significant issues. In this study, we found that the sensitivity of AML cells to venetoclax was considerably enhanced by ML385, an inhibitor of the ferroptosis factor nuclear transcription factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Using AML samples, we verified that NRF2 and its target gene ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) were highly expressed in patients with AML and correlated with poor prognosis. Downregulation of NRF2 could inhibit FTH1 expression and significantly enhance the venetoclax-induced labile iron pool and lipid peroxidation. By contrast, NRF2 overexpression or administration of the reactive oxygen species inhibitor N-acetylcysteine and vitamin E could effectively suppress the anti-AML effects of ML385+venetoclax. Furthermore, the ferroptosis inducer erastin increased the anti-AML effects of venetoclax. Our study demonstrated that NRF2 inhibition could enhance the AML cell death induced by venetoclax via the ferroptosis pathway. Thus, the combination of ML385 with venetoclax may offer a favorable strategy for AML treatment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cell Death Discovery"]},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41408-024-00977-0","title":["The constitutive activation of STAT3 gene and its mutations are at the crossroad between LGL leukemia and autoimmune disorders"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6061-4595","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gianpietro","family":"Semenzato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Giulia","family":"Calabretto","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2754-699X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonella","family":"Teramo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8689-3759","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vanessa Rebecca","family":"Gasparini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elisa","family":"Rampazzo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3430-6115","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gregorio","family":"Baril\u00e0","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8799-5324","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Renato","family":"Zambello","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Type T Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic disorder characterized by the abnormal proliferation of clonal cytotoxic T cells.

Studying the skin barrier function or the effects of drugs or cosmetic agents on human skin is a difficult task since snapshot evidence can only be obtained using bioptic samples where dynamic processes cannot properly be followed.

Method: A total of 857 Spanish university students were obtained through a stratified random cluster sampling method in a cross-sectional survey design study. Descriptive analysis of the items, partial-correlation network, Bayesian network model estimation, and invariance analysis by gender were conducted. Results: The instrument did not exhibit any floor or ceiling effects. Each item can be considered univariately normally distributed, and all items clustered in a single and stable community. The partial-correlation network model and centrality measures were stable in the full sample and invariant across genders. Item 3 emerged as the most central node in the network with the highest predictability. The Bayesian network indicated that items 2 and 4 initiate the process, while item 5 acts as the sink, and items 1 and 3 act as mediators. Conclusions: The SWLS can be used as a unidimensional measure, and the total score and relationships among items are stable and reliable. Any potential differences among genders cannot be associated with the functioning of the instrument.

The radial distributions of the COM emission, revealed by the detailed analyses of the line profiles, show the inner emission cavity, similar to the previous observations in Band 6 and Band 7. We found that the COMs abundance ratios with respect to methanol are significantly higher than those in the warm protostellar envelopes of IRAS 16293-2422 and similar to the ratios in the solar system comet 67P\/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, suggesting the efficient (re)formation of COMs in protoplanetary disks. We also constrained the <jats:sup>12<\/jats:sup>C\/<jats:sup>13<\/jats:sup>C and D\/H ratios of COMs in protoplanetary disks for the first time. The <jats:sup>12<\/jats:sup>C\/<jats:sup>13<\/jats:sup>C ratios of acetaldehyde, methyl formate, and dimethyl ether are consistently lower (\u223c20\u201330) than the canonical ratio in the interstellar medium (\u223c69), indicating the efficient <jats:sup>13<\/jats:sup>C-fractionation of CO. The D\/H ratios of methyl formate are slightly lower than the values in IRAS 16293-2422, possibly pointing to the destruction and reformation of COMs in disks. We also discuss the implications for nitrogen and sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Astronomical Journal"]},{"DOI":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1730-23.2024","title":["Diurnal variation of brain activity in the human suprachiasmatic nucleus"],"author":[{"given":"Satoshi","family":"Oka","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Akitoshi","family":"Ogawa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Takahiro","family":"Osada","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Masaki","family":"Tanaka","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Koji","family":"Nakajima","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Koji","family":"Kamagata","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shigeki","family":"Aoki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yasushi","family":"Oshima","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sakae","family":"Tanaka","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eiji","family":"Kirino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Takahiro J.","family":"Nakamura","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Seiki","family":"Konishi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central clock for circadian rhythms.

The main reason for this phenomenon is the extraordinary complexity of wireless signal propagation in forest scenarios.

In the pre-Last Glacial Maximum, the Guaymas Basin experienced alternating circulation patterns of California Current Water (CCW) and Gulf of California Water (GCW), with an extended presence of the Pacific Intermediate Water (PIW) owing to: amplified jet streams; southern movement of the California Current System (CCS) and the incursion of CCW into the gulf; and increased North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) formation. The Last Glacial Maximum witnessed the incursion of CCW due to the stronger CCS. The dominance of the PIW indicates the expansion and formation of NPIW. The Heinrich-I event as manifested in the core record, displays two distinct patterns, one suggesting GCW-like dominance and the other, the occurrence of CCW. The B\u00f8lling-\u00c5ller\u00f8d interstadial featured the entry of Tropical Surface Water (TSW), GCW, and CCW, linked with the northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In the Younger Dryas, CCW dominated, transitioning to GCW as colder climatic conditions and more intense CCS. The Holocene displayed alternating periods of TSW and GCW, with a modern monsoon regime from 7,600 to 1,000\u00a0cal\u00a0years BP.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between serum and hematological biomarkers with early onset neonatal sepsis in a cohort of patients with prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and to calculate their diagnostic accuracy. (2) Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1355 newborns with PROM admitted between January 2017 and March 2020, who were divided into two groups: group A, with PROM \u2265 18 h, and group B, with ROM &lt; 18 h. Both groups were further split into subgroups: proven sepsis, presumed sepsis, and no sepsis. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Random Effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression were used to evaluate the data. (3) Results: The statistically significant predictors of neonatal sepsis were the high white blood cell count from the first (p = 0.005) and third day (p = 0.028), and high C-reactive protein (CRP) values from the first day (p = 0.004). Procalcitonin (area under the curve\u2014AUC = 0.78) and CRP (AUC = 0.76) measured on the first day had the best predictive performance for early-onset neonatal sepsis. (4) Conclusions: Our results outline the feasibility of using procalcitonin and CRP measured on the first day taken individually in order to increase the detection rate of early-onset neonatal sepsis, in the absence of positive blood culture.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Children"]},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s12951-023-02282-7","title":["Thermosensitive hydrogel with emodin-loaded triple-targeted nanoparticles for a rectal drug delivery system in the treatment of chronic non-bacterial prostatitis"],"author":[{"given":"Yan","family":"Ye","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenzhen","family":"Zhong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ruifeng","family":"Luo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hongzhi","family":"Wen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ziyang","family":"Ma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shanshan","family":"Qi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiaoqin","family":"Han","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenbiao","family":"Nie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Degui","family":"Chang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Runchun","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Naijing","family":"Ye","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fei","family":"Gao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Peihai","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The complex etiology and pathogenesis underlying Chronic Non-Bacterial Prostatitis (CNP), coupled with the existence of a Blood Prostate Barrier (BPB), contribute to a lack of specificity and poor penetration of most drugs.

Additionally, hyaluronic acid (HA) is employed, recognizing CD44 receptors which target macrophages within the inflamed prostate. This interaction facilitates the intraprostatic delivery of EMO, leading to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. A thermosensitive hydrogel (CS-Gel) prepared from chitosan (CS) and \u03b2-glycerophosphate disodium salt (\u03b2-GP) was used for rectal drug delivery with strong adhesion to achieve effective drug retention and sustained slow release. Thus, we developed a triple-targeted nanoparticle (NPs)\/thermosensitive hydrogel (Gel) rectal drug delivery system. In this process, LF, with its positive charge, was utilized to load EMO through dialysis, producing LF@EMO-NPs. Subsequently, HA was employed to encapsulate EMO-loaded LF nanoparticles via electrostatic adsorption, yielding HA\/LF@EMO-NPs. Finally, HA\/LF@EMO-NPs lyophilized powder was added to CS-Gel (HA\/LF@EMO-NPs Gel).<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Cellular assays indicated that NCM-460 and RWPE-1 cells showed high uptake of both LF@EMO-NPs and HA\/LF@EMO-NPs, while Raw 264.7 cells exhibited substantial uptake of HA\/LF@EMO-NPs.

Tissue imaging corroborated the capacity of HA\/LF-modified formulations to breach the BPB, accumulating within the gland's lumen. Animal experiments showed that rectal administration of HA\/LF@EMO-NPs Gel significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, oxidative stress levels and fibrosis in the CNP rats, in addition to exerting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway without obvious toxicity.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This triple-targeted NPs\/Gel rectal delivery system with slow-release anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-fibrosis properties shows great potential for the effective treatment of CNP.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Graphical Abstract<\/jats:title>\n                \n              <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Journal of Nanobiotechnology"]},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s10503-023-09626-5","title":["Some Benefits and Limitations of Modern Argument Map Representation"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8998-2220","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Charles","family":"Rathkopf","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Argument maps represent some arguments more effectively than others. The goal of this article is to account for that variability, so that those who wish to use argument maps can do so with more foresight. I begin by identifying four properties of argument maps that make them useful tools for evaluating arguments. Then, I discuss four types of argument that are difficult to map well: reductio ad absurdum arguments, charges of equivocation, logical analogies, and mathematical arguments. The difficulties presented by these four types appear unrelated to one another, but I show that, in each case, the difficulty can be traced back to the use of metalinguistic reasoning. The need to represent a transition between object language and metalanguage can undermine one or more of the benefits that argument map representation would otherwise confer.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Argumentation"]},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s12917-023-03874-z","title":["The impact of different levels of wheat diets on hepatic oxidative stress, immune response, and lipid metabolism in Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries)"],"author":[{"given":"Boyan","family":"Ma","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sayed Haidar Abbas","family":"Raza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sameer D.","family":"Pant","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhanhong","family":"Gao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fengshuo","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhiyou","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shengzhen","family":"Hou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mariam Abdulaziz","family":"Alkhateeb","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Waleed","family":"Al Abdulmonem","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yousef Mesfer","family":"Alharbi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abdullah S.

A single-level KG was constructed through data features, and a multilevel KG with a stereostructure was built using a multi-source data fusion model as data support for FD. Second, we proposed an approach based on multilevel KG and Bayes theory to detect the system state and located the source of faults by combining the KG reasoning based on relational paths, then used the relationships between the structures of rotating mechanical equipment for fault cause reasoning and used the KG as a knowledge base for a reason using machine learning. Finally, the proposed method was validated using a steelworks motor as an example and compared with other ways, such as rule-based FD.

To improve these problems, schools should pay attention to the flexibility and individuation of the teaching, strengthen the training and introduction of teachers, explore innovative teaching methods, and establish a perfect teaching evaluation system to improve students' football skills and theoretical knowledge reserve.\nMaterials and Methods: The participants of this research were 29 people through purposive sampling. 5 experts to conduct face-to-face interviews to combine programs for the football model framework. 5 IOC inspection specialists to check the validity of the questionnaire. 19 experts to Delphi consensus modify the program for football model framework. 9 experts for a focus group to determine the program for the football model. In this research, Excel software was used to calculate the data of the IOC inspection specialist result and the data of the focus group. The coefficient of variation (CV) and the median were used as the evaluation criteria for screening factors.\nResults: The analysis indicated the need for a comprehensive system for teaching soccer courses in higher education. The football teaching model contains 4 first-level elements (pedagogical analysis, teaching development, competition, and orientation), which are further divided into 15 second-level elements and 38 third-level elements. Each component addresses a specific outcome goal, emphasizing teaching and learning situations, teaching construction, competition, and cultivation orientation. The proposed outcome-oriented soccer teaching system provides a comprehensive soccer teaching teaching model that integrates sport-specific skills and life-oriented skills.\nConclusion: The model is in line with China's national development goals and the educational principle of building moral character and is expected to bring about changes in soccer education at Xi'an Physical Education Academy and set a benchmark for other provinces.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science Reviews"]},{"DOI":"10.1177\/09544119231225528","title":["Simple recognition of hand gestures using single-channel EMG signals"],"author":[{"given":"Mina","family":"Pourmokhtari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Biomechatronics and Cognitive Engineering Research Lab, School of Mechanical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8408-5096","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Borhan","family":"Beigzadeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Biomechatronics and Cognitive Engineering Research Lab, School of Mechanical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Electromyography (EMG) signals are used for many different purposes, such as recording and measuring the electrical activity generated by varying the body\u2019s skeletal muscles.

While all\n            <jats:italic>Escherichia coli<\/jats:italic>\n            express the enterobactin (Ent) siderophore system, isolates from patients with urinary tract infections additionally express the genetically distinct yersiniabactin (Ybt) siderophore system. To determine whether the Ent and Ybt systems are functionally redundant for iron uptake, we compared the growth of different isogenic siderophore biosynthetic mutants in the presence of transferrin, a human iron-binding protein. We observed that Ybt expression does not compensate for deficient Ent expression following low-density inoculation. Using transcriptional and product analysis, we found this non-redundancy to be attributable to a density-dependent transcriptional stimulation cycle in which Ybt functions as an autoinducer. These results distinguish the Ybt system as a combined quorum-sensing and siderophore system. These functions may reflect Ybt as a public good within bacterial communities or as an adaptation to confined, subcellular compartments in infected hosts.

One of these adaptations is the accumulation of multiple siderophore systems, which scavenge iron for nutritional use. While iron uptake is important for bacterial growth, the increased metabolic costs of siderophore production could diminish bacterial fitness during infections. In a siderophore-dependent growth condition, we show that the virulence-associated yersiniabactin siderophore system in uropathogenic\n              <jats:italic>E. coli<\/jats:italic>\n              is not redundant with the ubiquitous\n              <jats:italic>E. coli<\/jats:italic>\n              enterobactin system. This arises not from differences in iron-scavenging activity but because yersiniabactin is preferentially expressed during bacterial crowding, leaving bacteria dependent upon enterobactin for growth at low cell density. Notably, this regulatory mode arises because yersiniabactin stimulates its own expression, acting as an autoinducer in a previously unappreciated quorum-sensing system.

In this article, we discuss expert opinions and clinical experiences on the topic of maintenance therapy for patients with MF, with a focus on chlormethine gel. Ideally, patients should have a durable response before initiating maintenance therapy. The definition of and required duration of durable response are topics that are open to debate and currently have no consensus. Chlormethine gel has several attributes that make it suitable for maintenance therapy; it can be easily applied at home, can be combined with other treatment options for maintenance, and has a manageable safety profile. Chlormethine gel as maintenance therapy can be applied at decreasing frequencies after active treatment with chlormethine gel or other therapies until the minimally effective dose is reached. Patients generally tend to adhere well to chlormethine gel maintenance regimens and may remain on treatment for several years. The experiences described here may be useful for clinicians when deciding on maintenance treatment regimens for their patients. Development of guidelines based on clinical trial outcomes will be important to ensure the most effective maintenance treatment strategies are used for patients with MF.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Medicine"]},{"DOI":"10.1128\/mra.00576-23","title":["Draft genome sequence of\n            <i>Enterobacter sp<\/i>\n            . from wheat grain"],"author":[{"given":"Niradha Withana","family":"Gamage","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Grain Research Laboratory, Canadian Grain Commission, Winnipeg, Canada"}]},{"given":"Tehreem","family":"Ashfaq","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Grain Research Laboratory, Canadian Grain Commission, Winnipeg, Canada"}]},{"given":"Tiffany","family":"Chin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Grain Research Laboratory, Canadian Grain Commission, Winnipeg, Canada"}]},{"given":"Janice","family":"Bamforth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Grain Research Laboratory, Canadian Grain Commission, Winnipeg, Canada"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3866-5038","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Sean","family":"Walkowiak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Grain Research Laboratory, Canadian Grain Commission, Winnipeg, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT<\/jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            Here, we report the draft genome sequence of an isolate from the\n            <jats:italic>Enterobacter cloacae<\/jats:italic>\n            species complex.\n            <jats:italic>Enterobacter<\/jats:italic>\n            spp. are plant growth-promoting microbes and biocontrol agents.

The early detection of the disease is often hampered by inadequate surveillance. Among the surveillance strategies used, passive surveillance of wild boars is considered the most effective method for controlling the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Otherwise, the design of a sufficiently sensitive ASF surveillance system requires a solid understanding of the epidemiology related to the local eco-social context, especially in the absence of virus detection. Even if the number of carcasses needed to demonstrate ASF eradication has been established, the scientific context lacks detail compared to protocols applied in the active search for wild boar carcasses. The aim of this study was to describe the protocol applied in the active search for carcasses, providing detailed information on the number of people and dogs as well as the amount of time and space used within the Mediterranean area. Using a specific tool developed to record, trace, and share field data (the GAIA observer app), a total of 33 active searches for wild boar carcasses were organized during 2021\u20132023. Most of these searches were planned to find carcasses that had previously been reported by hunters. A total of 24 carcasses were found, with only 2 carcasses not previously reported. The final protocol applied involved four people, with an average speed of 1.5 km\/h. When a carcass had been previously reported, about 2 km of distance had to be covered in about 1.5 h to find the carcass, and even less time was spent when a dog (untrained) was present. In conclusion, it can be stated that, when searching for carcasses, solid collaboration with local hunters or other forest visitors is necessary to ensure carcasses are reported. The process involves small groups of experts actively searching for carcasses, possibly with the use of hunting dogs without special training. The data presented could be of valid support for those countries characterized by Mediterranean vegetation that are faced with the need to plan active carcass searches.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Viruses"]},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s12883-023-03521-y","title":["Real-world experience with calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeted antibodies for migraine prevention: a retrospective observational cohort study at two Japanese headache centers"],"author":[{"given":"Mamoru","family":"Shibata","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kazuki","family":"Fujita","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eri","family":"Hoshino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kazushi","family":"Minami","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kenzo","family":"Koizumi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Satoshi","family":"Okada","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fumihiko","family":"Sakai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-targeted monoclonal antibodies (CGRP mAbs) are an efficacious and safe therapeutic modality for migraine prevention, their clinical benefits have not been well validated in Japanese patients in the real-world setting.

However, traditional 3D reconstruction methods like LiDAR present challenges primarily because of their lack of portability. Additionally, they encounter complexities related to feature point extraction and matching within multi-view stereo vision sensors. In this research, we propose a new method that not only reconstructs the forest environment but also performs a more detailed tree reconstruction in the scene using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) based on a single RGB image. Firstly, we introduced a depth estimation network based on a CGAN. This network aims to reconstruct forest scenes from images and has demonstrated remarkable performance in accurately reconstructing intricate outdoor environments. Subsequently, we designed a new tree silhouette depth map to represent the tree\u2019s shape as derived from the tree prediction network. This network aims to accomplish a detailed 3D reconstruction of individual trees masked by instance segmentation. Our approach underwent validation using the Cityscapes and Make3D outdoor datasets and exhibited exceptional performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, such as GCNDepth. It achieved a relative error as low as 8% (with an absolute error of 1.76 cm) in estimating diameter at breast height (DBH). Remarkably, our method outperforms existing approaches for single-image reconstruction. It stands as a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to conventional forest survey methods like LiDAR and SFM techniques. The significance of our method lies in its contribution to technical support, enabling the efficient and detailed utilization of 3D forest scene reconstruction for various applications.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Forests"]},{"DOI":"10.1186\/s12936-024-04847-9","title":["Presence and abundance of malaria vector species in Miami-Dade County, Florida"],"author":[{"given":"Andr\u00e9 B.

While GC is known to regulate the expression of genes related to inflammation in immune cells, the effects of GC, especially in the presence of inflammation, on non-immune cells remain largely unexplored. In particular, the impact of GC on inflammatory cytokine-induced immune modulatory responses of tissue stromal cells is unknown, though it has been widely used to modulate tissue injuries. Here we found that GC could enhance the expression of TSG6, a vital tissue repair effector molecule, in IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 treated human umbilical cord (UC)-MSCs. NF-\u03baB activation was found to be required for GC-augmented TSG6 upregulation. STAT3, but not STAT1, was also found to be required for the TSG6 upregulation in MSCs exposed to IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and GC. Moreover, the phosphorylation (activation) of STAT3 was attenuated when NF-\u03baB was knocked down. Importantly, human UC-MSCs pretreated with a cocktail containing GC, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 could significantly enhance the therapeutic effect of human UC-MSCs in an acute lung injury mouse model, as reflected by reduced infiltration of immune cells and down-regulation of iNOS in macrophages in the lung. Together, the findings reveal a novel link between GR, NF-\u03baB and STAT3 in regulating the immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of MSCs, providing novel information for the understanding and treatment of inflammatory conditions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cell Death &amp; Disease"]},{"DOI":"10.31223\/x5jh42","title":["The Whakamaru Magmatic System (Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone, New Zealand), Part 1: Evidence from tephra deposits for the eruption of multiple magma types through time"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9985-705X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lydia","family":"Harmon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0720-2679","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Guilherme","family":"Gualda","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Darren","family":"Gravley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Smithies","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chad","family":"Deering","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The Whakamaru group eruptions (349 \u00b1 4 ka; Downs et al., 2014) are the largest known eruptions in the history of the young Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone, Aotearoa New Zealand.

We present new evidence from fall deposits correlated with the Whakamaru eruptions to complement the ignimbrite record. Two coastal sections are characterized in detail. We group the tephra horizons into three packages: the older, smaller Tablelands and Paerata tephras; the overlying Kohioawa tephras (correlated with Whakamaru group eruptions); and the younger Murupara and Bonisch tephras. Major- and trace-element compositions suggest these tephras represent six distinct high-silica magma types, with the Kohioawa tephras representing three distinct magma compositions that are atypical of the TVZ. The distribution of Kohioawa magma types (types A, B, and C) changes through time, with the oldest deposits containing exclusively type A magma, the middle deposits containing types A and B, and the youngest deposits containing all three Kohioawa types. A combination of horizon-scale mineralogy and rhyolite-MELTS modeling suggests that only Kohioawa types B and C are saturated in sanidine \u2013 the presence of sanidine is atypical in Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone magmas but has been previously documented in the Whakamaru group ignimbrites.

The optimized SNEDDS formulation showed excellent dissolution profiles for all the drugs released at 10 min of dissolution due to the increased surface area with a small particle size of approximately 16 nm. Additionally, it was confirmed to be stable without significant differences in physical and chemical properties for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 75 \u00b1 5% RH) and stressed conditions (60 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C).

This method leads to an explicit approximation formula in terms of theta functions and related algebro-geometric ingredients that is difficult to directly link to the expected limiting differential equation. However, the approximation arises from an outer parametrix that satisfies relatively simple conditions. By applying a method that we learned from Alexander Its, it is possible to use these simple conditions to directly obtain the limiting differential equation, bypassing the details of the algebro-geometric solution of the outer parametrix problem.

N. gonorrhoea\u2019s ability to evolve and evade various treatment regimens can lead to untreatable gonorrhoea. In the absence of a viable vaccine, a national database on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and molecular characteristics of N. gonorrhoea, and the reliance on a syndromic management regime, continuous national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and molecular characterisation of N. gonorrhoea remain imperative. Only two gonococcal studies have described its molecular characteristics linked to AMR in Ghana.\nMethods: Secondary N. gonorrhoea isolates (n=4) were collected from two metropolises in Ghana: Tamale in the northern sector (n=1) and Accra in the southern sector (n=3). The isolates were confirmed and characterised using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the porB and tbpB genes, and the disk diffusion method was used to evaluate antimicrobial resistance (AMR). N. gonorrhoea Multi-Antigen Sequence Typing (NG-MAST) and porin B (porB) gene sequence analyses were used to reveal molecular epidemiology and evolutionary trajectory, respectively.\nResults: All four isolates showed resistance to at least four of the tested antibiotics. One isolate showed resistance to all seven antibiotics, i.e. Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin, Tetracycline, Erythromycin, Togamycin and Penicillin. \u00a0NG-MAST typing revealed isolates S3 (MZ313864) as ST211. The locus of S2 (MZ313863) (transferrin binding protein B; tbpB) was identified as tbpB1844, and its porin, porB locus, as porB6412 with only four closely related variants but with 15 nucleotide differences. However, its sequence type does not exist. The PorB analysis identified isolate S3 (MZ313864) to be found globally, while S2 (MZ313863) is unique to this study.\nDiscussion: Despite the small number of isolates tested, this study recorded multidrug resistance and previously unknown gonococcal variants. Additionally, the molecular typing schemes revealed a disparity between NG-MAST and NCBI. There is a need for continuous gonococcal AMR and molecular surveillance in Ghana to contribute to the global efforts of describing circulating strains and to support a proper application of the syndromic management regime to gonorrhoea.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.1097\/ms9.0000000000001745","title":["Recurrent Tolosa-Hunt syndrome: A case report"],"author":[{"given":"Shashank","family":"Neupane","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Prasamsa","family":"Pudasaini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Bishal","family":"Dhakal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Pasang","family":"Sherpa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Nepal Medical College, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Pooja","family":"Rokaya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]},{"given":"Anukul","family":"Subedi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Sinamangal, Kathmandu, Nepal"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Introduction and importance:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome is a rare condition with unknown etiology that manifests clinically as unilateral orbital pain and ophthalmoplegia.

At present, the treatment methods of OS mainly include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical therapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with limb salvage surgery. These treatment methods can relieve the clinical symptoms of patients to a certain extent, and also effectively reduce the disability rate, mortality and recurrence rate of OS patients. However, because metastasis of tumor cells leads to new complications, and OS cells become resistant with prolonged drug intervention, which reduces the sensitivity of OS cells to drugs, these treatments still have some limitations. More and more studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the characteristics of \u201cmultiple targets and multiple pathways,\u201d and can play an important role in the development of OS through several key signaling pathways, including PI3K\/AKT, Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin, tyrosine kinase\/transcription factor 3 (JAK\/STAT3), Notch, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)\/Smad, nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Hippo\/YAP, OPG\/RANK\/RANKL, Hedgehog and so on. In this paper, the signaling pathways of cross-interference between active ingredients of TCM and OS were reviewed, and the development status of novel OS treatment was analyzed. The active ingredients in TCM can provide therapeutic benefits to patients by targeting the activity of signaling pathways. In addition, potential strategies for targeted therapy of OS by using ferroptosis were discussed. We hope to provide a unique insight for the in-depth research and clinical application of TCM in the fields of OS growth, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance by understanding the signaling crosstalk between active ingredients in TCM and OS.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Medicine"]},{"DOI":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.006228","title":["Aquimarina aquimarini sp. nov. and Aquimarina spinulae sp. nov., novel bacterial species with versatile natural product biosynthesis potential isolated from marine sponges"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1824-5017","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joana F.","family":"Couceiro","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Bioengeneering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, University of Lisbon, Av.

implementation, bundle compliance, process of care, safety, and the factors influencing implementation. Secondary endpoints were the impact of the bundle on clinical outcomes such as pain, delirium, iatrogenic withdrawal, ventilator-free days, length of stay, and mortality. Implementation occurred over 26 months (August 2018 to October 2020). Data were collected on 1,036 patients representing 4,065 patient days. Bundle compliance was optimized within 6 months of roll-out. Goal setting for mobilization and level of arousal improved significantly (<jats:italic toggle=\"yes\">p<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0.01). Benzodiazepine, opioid, and dexmedetomidine use decreased in site 1 by 23.2% (95% CI, 30.8\u201315.5%), 26.1% (95% CI, 34.8\u201317.4%), and 9.2% (95% CI, 18.2\u20130.2%) patient exposure days, respectively, while at site 2, only dexmedetomidine exposure decreased significantly by 10.5% patient days (95% CI, 19.8\u20131.1%). Patient comfort, safety, and nursing workload were not adversely affected. There was no significant impact of the bundle on the rate of delirium, ventilator-free days, length of PICU stay, or mortality. Key facilitators to implementation included institutional support, unit-wide practice guidelines, dedicated PICU educators, easily accessible resources, and family engagement.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>A rehabilitation bundle can improve processes of care and reduce patient sedative exposure without increasing patient discomfort, nursing workload, or harm.

The emergence and spread of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in new epidemiological regions, such as recent cases in Australia and non-endemic areas like Pune, India, raise significant concerns. With an estimated 68,000 clinical cases and 13,600 to 20,400 deaths annually, JEV poses a substantial global health threat. The virus primarily affects children, with a case-fatality ratio of 20%-30% and long-term neurological sequelae in survivors. The changing epidemiology, influenced by factors like bird migration, climate change, and increased urbanization, contributes to the geographic expansion of JEV. The recent outbreaks underscore the potential for the virus to establish itself in non-endemic regions, posing a threat to populations previously considered at low risk. With limited treatment options and high rates of neurological complications, continued surveillance, traveler vaccination, and research into treatments are crucial to mitigate the impact of JEV on human health.

This article critically explores this narrative and locates it in the context of the events of the past two decades in the WTO. It challenges the notion of ROL in the world trading system. It argues that although significant progress was made in mainstreaming ROL in the Uruguay Round project, it would be an exaggeration to claim that ROL was embedded in the trading system from its inception.

It is home to both commercially harvested species and those that are federally listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Recently, there has been a global shift from single-species fisheries management to ecosystem-based fisheries management, which acknowledges that more complex dynamics can reverberate through a food web. Here, we have integrated new research into an end-to-end ecosystem model (i.e., physics to fisheries) using data from long-term ocean surveys, phytoplankton satellite imagery paired with a vertically generalized production model, a recently assembled diet database, fishery catch information, species distribution models, and existing literature. This spatially-explicit model includes 90 living and detrital functional groups ranging from phytoplankton, krill, and forage fish to salmon, seabirds, and marine mammals, and nine fisheries that occur off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. This model was updated from previous regional models to account for more recent changes in the Northern California Current (e.g., increases in market squid and some gelatinous zooplankton such as pyrosomes and salps), to expand the previous domain to increase the spatial resolution, to include data from previously unincorporated surveys, and to add improved characterization of endangered species, such as Chinook salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha<\/jats:italic>) and southern resident killer whales (<jats:italic>Orcinus orca<\/jats:italic>). Our model is mass-balanced, ecologically plausible, without extinctions, and stable over 150-year simulations. Ammonium and nitrate availability, total primary production rates, and model-derived phytoplankton time series are within realistic ranges. As we move towards holistic ecosystem-based fisheries management, we must continue to openly and collaboratively integrate our disparate datasets and collective knowledge to solve the intricate problems we face. As a tool for future research, we provide the data and code to use our ecosystem model.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["PLOS ONE"]},{"DOI":"10.1142\/s1793524523501048","title":["Identifying function modules from protein\u2013protein interaction networks based on Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s Regularity Lemma"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0770-9018","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Changxiang","family":"He","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Science, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Jungong Road, Shanghai 200093, P.

Traditional methods for studying proteins in Protein\u2013Protein Interaction (PPI) networks typically only extract the first-order or second-order neighbor information of proteins, ignoring the potential third-order or higher-order neighbor information between proteins, which may hide certain relationships between proteins. To explore more in-depth insights for PPI networks, we take into account the fourth-order neighbor information of proteins and reconstruct the network in this paper, naming it the weighted dense PPI network. We then partition it using SRL, which primarily utilizes the structural information and corresponds to a unique partition of the original network. Bioinformatics analyses such as those for pathway enrichment analysis and multiple sequence alignment show that our method can classify interacting protein pairs, grouping proteins with functional association, disease association, and sequence similarity together. Overall, this paper has three essential contributions: (1) we present a new model to overcome the astronomically large demand of vertices in applying SRL, and achieve protein classification; (2) we reconstruct a weighted dense PPI network which can make SRL work and mine potential interactions more efficiently; and (3) proteins in the same class partitioned by our method not only have sequence similarity, but also have functional associations. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Biomathematics"]},{"DOI":"10.1142\/s0218348x24400115","title":["QUALITATIVE AND STABILITY ANALYSIS WITH LYAPUNOV FUNCTION OF EMOTION PANIC SPREADING MODEL INSIGHT OF FRACTIONAL OPERATOR"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5545-6185","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"PEILUAN","family":"LI","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471023, P.

Hospital care pathways that focus on single presenting complaints do not address this pressing problem. This has the potential to precipitate frequent hospital readmissions, increase health system and out-of-pocket expenses, and may lead to premature disability and death. We aim to present a description of inpatient multimorbidity in a multicentre prospective cohort study in Malawi and Tanzania. Primary objectives Clinical: Determine prevalence of multimorbid disease among adult medical admissions and measure patient outcomes. Health Economic: Measure economic costs incurred and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 days post-admission. Situation analysis: Qualitatively describe pathways of patients with multimorbidity through the health system. Secondary objectives Clinical: Determine hospital readmission free survival and markers of disease control 90 days after admission. Health Economic: Present economic costs from patient and health system perspective, sub-analyse costs and HRQoL according to presence of different diseases. Situation analysis: Understand health literacy related to their own diseases and experience of care for patients with multimorbidity and their caregivers. Methods This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of adult (\u226518 years) acute medical hospital admissions with nested health economic and situation analysis in four hospitals: 1) Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi; 2) Chiradzulu District Hospital, Malawi; 3) Hai District Hospital, Boma Ng\u2019ombe, Tanzania; 4) Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Follow-up duration will be 90 days from hospital admission. We will use consecutive recruitment within 24 hours of emergency presentation and stratified recruitment across four sites. We will use point-of-care tests to refine estimates of disease pathology.

We used statistical integration to combine technical expert panelists\u2019 judgements and content analysis of open-ended survey responses. Our literature search and internal screening resulted in 61 practice-based quality indicators for rating. We developed technical definitions for indicators endorsed in the first questionnaire (n = 55).

The most famous methoxyfuranocoumarins (MFCs), bergapten, xanthotoxin, isopimpinellin, phellopterin, byakangelicol, byakangelicin, isobergapten, pimpinellin, sphondin, as well as rare ones such as peucedanin and 8-methoxypeucedanin, apaensin, cnidilin, moellendorffiline and dahuribiethrins, have recently been investigated for their various biological activities. The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity and antioxidant potential of moellendorffiline, the antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of non-UV-activated bergapten and xanthotoxin, the effect of MFC on the activity of tyrosinase, acetyl- and butylcholinesterase, and the role of these compounds as adjuvants in anticancer and antibacterial tests have been confirmed. The anticonvulsant effects of halfordin, the antidepressant effects of xanthotoxin, and the antiadipogenic, neuroprotective, anti-amyloid-\u03b2, and anti-inflammatory (via increasing SIRT 1 protein expression) properties of phellopterin, as well as the activity of sphondin against hepatitis B virus, have also attracted interest. It is worth paying attention to the agonistic effect of xanthotoxin on bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) on cardiomyocytes, which may be important in the future treatment of tachycardia, as well as the significant anti-inflammatory activity of dahuribiethrins. It should be emphasized that MFCs, although in many cases isolated for the first time many years ago, are still of great interest as bioactive molecules. The aim of this review is to highlight key recent developments in the study of the diverse biological activities of MFCs and attempt to highlight promising directions for their further research. Where possible, descriptions of the mechanisms of action of MFC are provided, which is related to the constantly discovered therapeutic potential of these molecules. The review covers the results of experiments from the last ten years (2014\u20132023) conducted on isolated natural cMFCs and includes the activity of molecules that have not been activated by UV rays.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Current Issues in Molecular Biology"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/clinpract14010013","title":["Association between Family History of Breast Cancer and Breast Density in Saudi Premenopausal Women Participating in Mammography Screening"],"author":[{"given":"Ibrahem Hussain","family":"Kanbayti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"Mayada A.","family":"Alzahrani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"Yara O.","family":"Yeslam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"Noora H.","family":"Habib","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2517-7465","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ibrahim","family":"Hadadi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiological Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"Yousef","family":"Almaimoni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2346-7717","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Adnan","family":"Alahmadi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Radiologic Sciences Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"Ernest U.","family":"Ekpo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Medical Image Optimization and Perception Group (MIOPeG), Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Campus C4 75 East Street, Sydney, NSW 2141, Australia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Mammographic density and family history of breast cancer (FHBC) are well-established independent factors affecting breast cancer risk; however, the association between these two risk factors in premenopausal-screened women remains unclear.

Methods: A total of 446 eligible participants were included in the study. Mammographic density was assessed qualitatively using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS 4th edition). Logistic regression models were built to investigate the relationship between mammographic density and FHBC. Results: Women with a family history of breast cancer demonstrated an 87% greater chance of having dense tissue than women without a family history of breast cancer (95% CI: 1.14\u20133.08; p = 0.01). Having a positive family history for breast cancer in mothers was significantly associated with dense tissue (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 5.6; 95% CI: 1.3\u201324.1; p = 0.02).

This implies that the possibility of classical simulations of Pauli measurements in a given stabilizer state for qubit systems is closely tied to the experimental setup.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Quantum Reports"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/jcm13020579","title":["Weaning from Kidney Replacement Therapy in the Critically Ill Patient with Acute Kidney Injury"],"author":[{"given":"Kada","family":"Klouche","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit D\u00e9partement, Lapeyronie University Hospital Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France"},{"name":"Phymedexp, Faculty of Medicine, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Inserm, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), CHRU de Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1886-5996","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vincent","family":"Brunot","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit D\u00e9partement, Lapeyronie University Hospital Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7591-0901","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Romaric","family":"Larcher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit D\u00e9partement, Lapeyronie University Hospital Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France"},{"name":"Phymedexp, Faculty of Medicine, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Inserm, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), CHRU de Montpellier, 34295 Montpellier, France"}]},{"given":"Alexandre","family":"Lautrette","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer Jean PERRIN, M\u00e9decine Intensive R\u00e9animation, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, 63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Around 10% of critically ill patients suffer acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), with a mortality rate approaching 50%. Although most survivors achieve sufficient renal recovery to be weaned from KRT, there are no recognized guidelines on the optimal period for weaning from KRT. A systematic review was conducted using a peer-reviewed strategy, combining themes of KRT (intermittent hemodialysis, CKRT: continuous veno-venous hemo\/dialysis\/filtration\/diafiltration, sustained low-efficiency dialysis\/filtration), factors predictive of successful weaning (defined as a prolonged period without new KRT) and patient outcomes. Our research resulted in studies, all observational, describing clinical and biological parameters predictive of successful weaning from KRT. Urine output prior to KRT cessation is the most studied variable and the most widely used in practice. Other predictive factors, such as urinary urea and creatinine and new urinary and serum renal biomarkers, including cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), were also analyzed in the light of recent studies. This review presents the rationale for early weaning from KRT, the parameters that can guide it, and its practical modalities. Once the patient\u2019s clinical condition has stabilized and volume status optimized, a diuresis greater than 500 mL\/day should prompt the intensivist to consider weaning.

The frenetic effort made by shipping companies to decarbonize maritime transport must be followed by an unstoppable adaptation of ports from the historical supply of only fuel and diesel to covering the demands of new fuels, ensuring their renewable origin; onshore power supply (OPS); or even the storage of captured CO2. This article compiles the current environmental regulations applied to maritime transport to provide an analysis of the current situation and a link between vessels\u2019 requirements to comply with such regulations and port environmental infrastructure. This work demonstrates that technological development is growing faster onboard vessels than at ports. It is demonstrated that except for the case of LNG, the theoretical shipping fuel world demand of each type of alternative fuel cannot be absorbed by current world production, where we found big gaps between supply and demand of up to 96.9%. This work concludes that to speed up this process, ports will need European aid as well as private investment. It is proposed that for the next steps, the port system needs to provide the required infrastructure to vessels on time, which inevitably means improvements in competitiveness and governance to promote the blue economy and the concept of smart ports, attracting main international shipping lines with a complete decarbonization hub on their routes by taking advantage of the geostrategic role of the Iberian ports. At the same time, the port governance model must be more flexible in the decision-making process, anticipating changes in maritime regulations with the challenge of coordinating public and private interests, serving as a link, once again, between ship and society.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Sustainability"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/su16020882","title":["Systematic Review of the Use of the Walk-Along Interview Method to Assess Factors, Facilitators and Barriers Related to Perceived Neighborhood Environment and Walking Activity in Healthy Older Adults"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6159-0356","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Valkiria","family":"Amaya","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"AGEIS (Autonomie, G\u00e9rontologie, E-sant\u00e9, Imagerie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9), Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"},{"name":"PACTE (Laboratoire de Sciences Sociales), Sciences Po Grenoble, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, 38000 Grenoble, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9806-0639","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthias","family":"Chardon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"AGEIS (Autonomie, G\u00e9rontologie, E-sant\u00e9, Imagerie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9), Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2460-6384","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thibauld","family":"Moulaert","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"PACTE (Laboratoire de Sciences Sociales), Sciences Po Grenoble, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, 38000 Grenoble, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3773-393X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicolas","family":"Vuillerme","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"AGEIS (Autonomie, G\u00e9rontologie, E-sant\u00e9, Imagerie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9), Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, 38000 Grenoble, France"},{"name":"LabCom Telecom4Health, Orange Labs & Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Inria, Grenoble INP-UGA, 38000 Grenoble, France"},{"name":"Institut Universitaire de France, 75005 Paris, France"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Based on findings from a recent systematic review of the methodological aspects related to data collection for the walk-along interview (WAI) method applied to healthy older adults, complementary questions emerged, among them, what are the main outcomes of studies that have used the WAI?

Alternatively, spin-echo (SE) DSC can be used to achieve specific sensitivity to the capillary signal. For an improved contrast-to-noise ratio, ultra-high-field MRI makes this technique more appealing to study cerebral microvascular physiology. Therefore, this study assessed the applicability of SE-DSC MRI at 7 T. Forty-one elderly adults underwent 7 T MRI using a multi-slice SE-EPI DSC sequence. The cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were determined in the cortical grey matter (CGM) and white matter (WM) and compared to values from the literature. The relation of CBV and CBF with age and sex was investigated. Higher CBV and CBF values were found in CGM compared to WM, whereby the CGM-to-WM ratios depended on the amount of largest vessels excluded from the analysis. CBF was negatively associated with age in the CGM, while no significant association was found with CBV. Both CBV and CBF were higher in women compared to men in both CGM and WM.

While the influence of printing parameters on quasi-static mechanical characterization has been extensively considered within the literature, there are limited accounts of this effect on fatigue performance. The two main aims of this research are first to investigate the effects of the infill density percentage on the fatigue life of dog-bone samples under rotating bending cycling loads, and second to model the fatigue life using W\u00f6hler and Basquin models. The experiments exhibit a high variability of results, especially for low cyclic loads. The S\u2013N curves show that the number of cycles at failure increases with the increase in the infill density percentage and decreases with the increase in loads. Investigations allow the formulation of each constant model as a function of the infill density percentage. The new fatigue model formulations exhibit good agreement with the experimental data. As an outcome of this study, the fatigue model for 3D-printed parts may be expressed as a function of the infill density percentage using fewer tests in the future and for other polymers used in fused filament fabrication.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Materials"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/jmse12010183","title":["Enhanced Removal of Dissolved Effluent Organic Matter in Wastewater Using Lignin-Based Biochar Supported Fe\u2013Cu Bimetallic Oxide Catalyst"],"author":[{"given":"Wenpeng","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"given":"Fanlong","family":"Kong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"},{"name":"Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"given":"Huazhen","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"given":"Chunyan","family":"Zhai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"given":"Yang","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"given":"Sen","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China"},{"name":"Carbon Neutrality and Eco-Environmental Technology Innovation Center of Qingdao, Qingdao 266071, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9940-8273","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hong","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Geography and Environmental Science, University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AB, UK"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The effluent discharged from wastewater treatment facilities frequently enters the ocean, posing a considerable threat to the health of marine life and humans.

Therefore, the recognition and prediction of traffic congestion patterns utilizing such data have become crucial. To that end, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can further enhance Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), contributing to the smart management of transportation systems and effectively tackling traffic congestion in cities. This study seeks to assess a wide range of models as potential solutions for an ML-based multi-step forecasting approach intended to improve traffic congestion prediction, particularly in areas with limited historical data. Various interpretable predictive algorithms, suitable for handling the complexity and spatiotemporal characteristics of urban traffic flow, were tested and eventually shortlisted based on their predictive performance. The forecasting approach selects the optimal model in each step to maximize the accuracy. The findings demonstrate that, in a 24 h step prediction, variating Ensemble Tree-Based (ETB) regressors like the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) exhibit superior performances compared to traditional Deep Learning (DL) methods.

Our results showed that the distance to aquaculture significantly increased the SOC and TN of sediments; the C\/N ratio of sediments was reduced by the distance to aquaculture. Distance to aquaculture and seagrasses significantly impacted the \u03b413C of sediments, and their significant interactive effects on the \u03b413C of sediments were found. Distance to aquaculture and seagrasses had significantly interactive effects on the cellulase activity of sediments. Distance to aquaculture and seagrasses separately reduced the invertase activity of sediments. SOC in the seagrass bed was significantly positively impacted by cellulase activity and polyphenol oxidase activity in sediments. Firmicutes, Desulfobacterota and Chloroflexi were the dominant taxa in the S1 and S2 locations. From the S1 location to the S2 location, the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Desulfobacterota increased. The functional profiles of COG were relatively similar between the S1 and S2 locations.

CSF virus (CSFV) has been endemic in Cuba since 1993, most likely following an escape of the highly virulent Margarita\/1958 strain. In recent years, chronic and persistent infections with low-virulent CSFV have been observed. Amino acid substitutions located in immunodominant epitopes of the envelope glycoprotein E2 of the attenuated isolates were attributed to positive selection due to suboptimal vaccination and control. To obtain a complete picture of the mutations involved in attenuation, we applied forward and reverse genetics using the evolutionary-related low-virulent CSFV\/Pinar del Rio (CSF1058)\/2010 (PdR) and highly virulent Margarita\/1958 isolates. Sequence comparison of the two viruses recovered from experimental infections in pigs revealed 40 amino acid differences. Interestingly, the amino acid substitutions clustered in E2 and the NS5A and NS5B proteins. A long poly-uridine sequence was identified previously in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of PdR. We constructed functional cDNA clones of the PdR and Margarita strains and generated eight recombinant viruses by introducing single or multiple gene fragments from Margarita into the PdR backbone. All chimeric viruses had comparable replication characteristics in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages. Recombinant PdR viruses carrying either E2 or NS5A\/NS5B of Margarita, with 36 or 5 uridines in the 3\u2032UTR, remained low virulent in 3-month-old pigs. The combination of these elements recovered the high-virulent Margarita phenotype. These results show that CSFV evolution towards attenuated variants in the field involved mutations in both structural and non-structural proteins and the UTRs, which act synergistically to determine virulence.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Viruses"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/v16010148","title":["Domestic Cat Hepadnavirus Antigens in Lymphoma Tissues.

Nanobiopesticides based on the Mentha piperita extract were prepared using the antisolvent precipitation method. The central composite design of response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to optimize different process parameters, e.g., the amounts of the stabilizer and plant extract.

The formulated biopesticides in the form of nanosuspensions showed good antibacterial activities as compared to the Mentha piperita extract against two phytopathogenic bacterial strains, Clavibacter michiganensis and Pseudomonas syringae. The M. piperita nanosuspension had higher antifungal efficacy against A. niger and F. oxysporum than the Mentha piperita extract. The M. piperita extract and its nanosuspensions were tested for pesticidal activity against the stored-grain insects Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus oryzae. Mentha piperita-based nanobiopesticides demonstrated significantly high (p\u2009 &lt; \u20090.05) average mortality of 84.4% and 77.7% against Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus oryzae, respectively.

Among the available energy resources, a fuel cell is the most affordable for transportation applications because of such advantages as moderate operating temperature, high energy density, and scalable size. It is a challenging task to optimize PEMFC operating parameters for the enhancement of performance. This paper provides a detailed study on the optimization of PEMFC operating parameters using a multilayer feed-forward neural network, a genetic algorithm, and the design of a multiport high-gain DC\u2013DC converter for hybrid electric vehicle application, which is capable of handling both a 6 kW PEMFC and an 80 AH 12 V heavy-duty battery. To trace the maximum power from the PEMFC, the most recent SFO-based MPPT control technique is implemented in this research work. Initially, a multilayer feed-forward neural network is trained using a back-propagation algorithm with experimental data. Then, the optimization phase is separately carried out in a neural-power software environment using a genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation study was carried out using the MATLAB\/R2022a platform to verify the converter performance along with the SFO-based MPPT controller.

Phytolacca acinosa Roxb. has a large amount of aboveground biomass and a rapid growth rate, and it has been identified as a novel type of Cd hyperaccumulator that can be harnessed for phytoremediation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of P. acinosa to Cd2+ stress remain largely unclear. In this study, the phenotype, biochemical, and physiological traits of P. acinosa seeds and seedlings were analyzed under different concentrations of Cd2+ treatments. The results showed higher Cd2+ tolerance of P. acinosa compared to common plants. Meanwhile, the Cd2+ content in shoots reached 449 mg\/kg under 10 mg\/L Cd2+ treatment, which was obviously higher than the threshold for Cd hyperaccumulators. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the adaptability of P. acinosa to Cd stress, RNA-Seq was used to examine transcriptional responses of P. acinosa to Cd stress. Transcriptome analysis found that 61 genes encoding TFs, 48 cell wall-related genes, 35 secondary metabolism-related genes, 133 membrane proteins and ion transporters, and 96 defense system-related genes were differentially expressed under Cd2+ stress, indicating that a series of genes were involved in Cd2+ stress, forming a complex signaling regulatory mechanism. These results provide new scientific evidence for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of P. acinosa response to Cd2+ stress and new clues for the molecular breeding of heavy metal phytoremediation.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plants"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/toxics12010088","title":["Efficient Removal of Hazardous P-Nitroaniline from Wastewater by Using Surface-Activated and Modified Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes with Mesostructure"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2435-5274","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tzong-Horng","family":"Liou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, 84 Gungjuan Rd., Taishan District, New Taipei City 24301, Taiwan"},{"name":"Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Chang Gung University, 259 Wenhua 1st Rd., Guishan District, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan"}]},{"given":"Jyun-Jie","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology, 84 Gungjuan Rd., Taishan District, New Taipei City 24301, Taiwan"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>P-nitroaniline (PNA) is an aniline compound with high toxicity and can cause serious harm to aquatic animals and plants.

Various parameters of transportation means should be coordinated both with the parameters of the open pit and meet the conditions of its operation. The authors have developed a universal system of criteria for selecting a dump truck model for open pit conditions. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the complex consideration of all known factors to date and criteria of dump truck selection and the allocation of four groups of criteria: technical, technological, environmental, economic, and organizational. The groups of criteria and specific criteria in each group were ranked by the degree of importance using the multi-criteria decision-making method FUCOM (Full Consistency Method). The methodology of creating criteria systems in conditions of influence on the choice of alternatives of a set of interrelated factors is presented. The peculiarity of the methodology is the evaluation of different sets of criteria by several groups of experts with different competencies. The obtained criterion ranks are recommended to be used by managers of mining enterprises to choose a dump truck model. The presented methodology is suitable for the development of new systems of criteria, considering significant changes in operating conditions or the emergence of factors not considered in this study.

This involves enhancing the ability to understand and model the interconnected, coevolving system of humans and the rest of nature, thus contributing to the design of sustainable landscapes. In this paper, we hypothesise that the spatial configuration of landscape components (the size and arrangement of tree clumps, paddocks, crops, water features, etc.) impacts the production of regulating ESs, which in turn have a leveraging effect on provisioning and cultural ESs. Drawing on the precepts of Ecological Field Theory, we present the development and implications of a conceptual Geographic Information System (GIS)-based model, ESMAX, that utilises the idiosyncratic distance-decay characteristics of regulating ESs. These \u2018ES fields\u2019 are visualised as radiating into the landscape from their source components, addressing a gap in biophysical reality that has been identified as a shortcoming of existing ES modelling based on landcover proxies. Hypothetical landscape arrangements of simplified landscape components are tested with ESMAX across three regulating ESs: cooling effect, nitrogen retention, and habitat provision. The model calculates the overall ES performance of each landscape arrangement by tabulating the ES fields produced and, critically, the nonlinear response where fields overlap. The results indicate a primary sensitivity to the size of components and a secondary sensitivity to the arrangement of components. Consequently, ESMAX can be used to design landscape configurations that (1) maximise the production of specific regulating ESs and (2) improve the utilisation of natural ES-producing resources.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Sustainability"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/app14020848","title":["Effects of La-Co Co-Substitution on the Structural and Magnetic Properties of SrM Hexaferrites Prepared by Solid-State Reaction"],"author":[{"given":"Kanghyuk","family":"Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7542-4196","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Young-Min","family":"Kang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Korea National University of Transportation, Chungju 27469, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Sang-Im","family":"Yoo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Research Institute of Advanced Materials (RIAM), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The effects of La-Co co-substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of strontium M-type hexaferrites (SrM) were carefully investigated for the Sr1\u2212xLaxFe12\u2212xCoxO19 (0.0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.3) polycrystalline samples prepared by solid-state reaction in air.

The reduction in c\/a ratios and Vcell values with increasing x up to x = 0.25 are obviously attributable to the decreasing size effect resulting from La3+ substitution at the Sr2+ site, which surpasses the increasing size effect due to Co2+ and Fe2+ occupancy at the Fe3+ site.

Recently, with the development of transcriptomic technologies, research on spermatogenesis in C. semilaevis has been focused on the ubiquitination pathway. In this study, we analyzed the function of the ubiquitin ligase rnf34 gene on the Z chromosome. A qPCR experiment showed that its expression level in the gonad was the highest among different tissues. In the ovary, the expression gradually increased with development from 40 days post-hatching (dph) to 1.5 years post-hatching (yph). In the testis, rnf34 showed increased expression from 40 dph to 6 months post-hatching (mpf) and stabilized up until 1.5 ypf. In situ hybridization showed that the mRNA of rnf34 was mainly distributed in the germ cells of the testis and the ovary. In vivo siRNA-mediated knockdown of the rnf34 gene in male fish affected the expression of a series of genes related to sex differentiation and spermatogenesis.

In this study, based on plant electrophysiological measurements, we chose Orychophragmus violaceus (Ov) as experimental material and determined the growth potential, water metabolism, and nutrient translocation capacity under HCO3\u2212-Se6+-Cd2+ treatment to identify the synergistic effects of bicarbonate and selenium on cadmium transport in karst-adaptable plants. We found 5 mM HCO3\u2212 and 0.46 mM Se6+ synergistically alleviated the Cd2+ stress on Ov, promoting growth, intracellular water metabolism, nutrient translocation efficiency, and total Se accumulation, and inhibiting the uptake of Cd in Ov. Nevertheless, 15 mM HCO3\u2212 and 0.46 mM Se6+ synergistically augmented Cd transport on Ov, resulting in growth reduction, intracellular water metabolism, nutrient translocation efficiency, and total Se concentration. Hence, it not only provides a frontier approach for the real-time monitoring of intracellular water and nutrient utilization capacity in plant species, but is also even more a theoretical idea that reveals the synergistic effects of bicarbonate and selenium on cadmium transport of plants to precisely indicate selenium supplementation to ameliorate cadmium pollution and construct a sustainable karst ecosystem in the future.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Agronomy"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/act13010041","title":["Investigation of Pressure Chambers for Integrated Fluidic Actuators in Adaptive Slabs"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9326-6913","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthias J.","family":"Bosch","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 9, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]},{"given":"Markus","family":"Nitzlader","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design (ILEK), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 14, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]},{"given":"Matthias","family":"Bachmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 9, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]},{"given":"Hansgeorg","family":"Binz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 9, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4592-6347","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lucio","family":"Blandini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design (ILEK), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 14, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4530-1248","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthias","family":"Kreimeyer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Engineering Design and Industrial Design (IKTD), University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 9, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>A high proportion of the CO2 emissions worldwide are caused by the construction sector or are associated with buildings. Every part of the industry needs to reduce its share of emissions, so the building sector must also do its part. One possible solution for achieving this reduction in the field of load-bearing structures is the use of adaptive structures. This research focuses on adaptive slab structures, which require specific actuators to be integrated into the system. Conventional actuators are not suitable due to the prevailing requirements, namely installation space and performance. For this investigation, the actuator is divided into different functional components. A rough description of the requirements for one component, namely the energy converter, is given. Different concepts are developed, tested, and compared with numerical results. Due to the requirements, the concepts are limited to hydraulics. The authors then present a comparison of different simulation strategies for the energy converter. Overall, this paper provides a new contribution to the design of energy converter concepts for integrated hydraulic actuators in slabs, along with experimental verification of the working principle of the energy converters to meet the requirements. A simplified numerical model is proposed to estimate the behavior of the energy converter during the early design phase.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Actuators"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fendo.2024.1275699","title":["Causal linkage between type 2 diabetes mellitus and inflammatory bowel disease: an integrated Mendelian randomization study and bioinformatics analysis"],"author":[{"given":"Xiang","family":"Xiao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xuanyu","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lu","family":"Yi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fengming","family":"You","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xueke","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chong","family":"Xiao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>Observational studies have indicated associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and both colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

In addition, differences in BSA estimates between existing formulae have been shown to be so large that they can affect patients\u2019 mortality, particularly in patients with atypical body types. This uncertainty associated with BSA prediction may decrease the confidence of practitioners when determining chemotherapy dosages, particularly with regards to the risk of excess toxicity from over-dosing, or a reduced anti-cancer effect due to under-dosing.

It is our view that the use of advanced body measurement techniques can provide practitioners with tools for prescribing chemotherapy dosages that are valid for individuals, regardless of their body type.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Applied Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ani14020313","title":["Protective Effects of Niacin on Rumen Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Heat-Stressed Beef Cattle"],"author":[{"given":"Bicheng","family":"Zou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Fan","family":"Long","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Fuguang","family":"Xue","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Chuanbin","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Xian","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Mingren","family":"Qu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]},{"given":"Lanjiao","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Engineering Research Center of Feed Development, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The present study investigates the theoretical basis for maintaining normal physiological functions in heat-stressed beef cattle by exploring the effects of niacin supplementation on the permeability of the rumen epithelial cell barrier. Herein, 12 Jinjiang bulls with an average weight of approximately 400 \u00b1 20.0 kg were randomly divided into three groups, thermoneutral (TN), heat-stressed (HS), and heat-stressed niacin-supplemented (HN) groups, with 4 bulls in each group. The experiment spanned 70 days, and the plasma concentrations of D-lactic acid, diamine oxidase (DAO), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. Additionally, we assessed the gene expression of tight junction proteins to understand the effect of niacin supplementation on heat-stressed beef cattle. Our results revealed that heat stress significantly increased the D-lactic acid and LPS levels in beef cattle plasma on days 30 and 45 of the experiment (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, it led to a significant rise in DAO levels on day 30 (p &lt; 0.05). Niacin supplementation significantly reduced the LPS levels on day 30 (p &lt; 0.05). Heat stress significantly elevated the plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (p &lt; 0.05), while reducing the IL-4 concentration (p &lt; 0.05). However, niacin supplementation effectively mitigated the concentrations of these inflammatory factors by reducing IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations and increasing IL-4 concentrations. The mRNA expressions of tight junction proteins zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1, claudin-4, and claudin-7 were significantly downregulated (p &lt; 0.05) in the HS group compared to those in the TN group, and those of ZO-1 and occludin were significantly upregulated (p &lt; 0.05) in the HN group compared to those in the HS group. Notably, no significant differences were observed in ruminal papillae length and width among the studied groups (p &gt; 0.05). Our findings indicate that heat stress adversely impacted the tight junction structure of the rumen epithelium, leading to a significant reduction in the expression of tight junction protein mRNA. Consequently, heat stress impaired the rumen mucosal barrier function, resulting in increased intestinal permeability. The mechanism underlying this effect may be associated with the decreased expression of tight junction protein genes in the rumen epithelial cells. However, niacin supplementation mitigated the detrimental effects of heat stress on intestinal permeability in beef cattle and increased the expression of tight junction protein genes in the rumen epithelium, thereby effectively protecting the rumen barrier in heat-stressed beef cattle. These results highlight the potential of nicotinic acid as a protective agent against the negative impacts of heat stress on intestinal integrity in beef cattle.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Animals"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/biom14010131","title":["TERT Promoter Methylation Is Oxygen-Sensitive and Regulates Telomerase Activity"],"author":[{"given":"Fatma","family":"Dogan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA"},{"name":"The Guy Hilton Research Laboratories, School of Pharmacy and Bioengineering, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Keele University, Stoke on Trent ST4 7QB, UK"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5156-4824","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicholas R.","family":"Forsyth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Guy Hilton Research Laboratories, School of Pharmacy and Bioengineering, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Keele University, Stoke on Trent ST4 7QB, UK"},{"name":"Vice Principals Office, Kings College, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 3FX, UK"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Telomere repeats protect linear chromosomes from degradation, and telomerase has a prominent role in their maintenance. Telomerase has telomere-independent effects on cell proliferation, DNA replication, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase enzyme), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is required for enzyme activity. TERT promoter mutation and methylation are strongly associated with increased telomerase activation in cancer cells. TERT levels and telomerase activity are downregulated in stem cells during differentiation. The link between differentiation and telomerase can provide a valuable tool for the study of the epigenetic regulation of TERT. Oxygen levels can affect cellular behaviors including proliferation, metabolic activity, stemness, and differentiation. The role of oxygen in driving TERT promoter modifications in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is poorly understood. We adopted a monolayer ESC differentiation model to explore the role of physiological oxygen (physoxia) in the epigenetic regulation of telomerase and TERT. We further hypothesized that DNMTs played a role in physoxia-driven epigenetic modification. ESCs were cultured in either air or a 2% O2 environment. Physoxia culture increased the proliferation rate and stemness of the ESCs and induced a slower onset of differentiation than in ambient air. As anticipated, downregulated TERT expression correlated with reduced telomerase activity during differentiation. Consistent with the slower onset of differentiation in physoxia, the TERT expression and telomerase activity were elevated in comparison to the air-oxygen-cultured ESCs. The TERT promoter methylation levels increased during differentiation in ambient air to a greater extent than in physoxia. The chemical inhibition of DNMT3B reduced TERT promoter methylation and was associated with increased TERT gene and telomerase activity during differentiation. DNMT3B ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) demonstrated that downregulated TERT expression and increased proximal promoter methylation were associated with DNMT3B promoter binding. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that DNMT3B directly associates with TERT promoter, is associated with differentiation-linked TERT downregulation, and displays oxygen sensitivity. Taken together, these findings help identify novel aspects of telomerase regulation that may play a role in better understanding developmental regulation and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biomolecules"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/fmars.2023.1296274","title":["Predicting rapid intensification of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific: a machine learning and net energy gain rate approach"],"author":[{"given":"Sung-Hun","family":"Kim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Woojeong","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hyoun-Woo","family":"Kang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sok Kuh","family":"Kang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In this study, a machine learning (ML)-based Tropical Cyclones (TCs) Rapid Intensification (RI) prediction model has been developed by using the Net Energy Gain Rate Index (<jats:italic>NGR<\/jats:italic>).

Recently, 3D printing technology has been widely used to fabricate reliable, reproducible and economically affordable scaffolds with specifically designed shapes and porosity, capable of providing sufficient biomimetic cues for a desired cellular behaviour. Natural or synthetic polymers reinforced with active bioceramics and\/or graphene derivatives have demonstrated adequate mechanical properties and a proper cellular response, attracting the attention of researchers in the bone regeneration field. In the present work, 3D-printed graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA)\/hydroxyapatite (HA) composite scaffolds were fabricated using the fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique. The in vitro response of the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages revealed that these newly designed scaffolds exhibited various survival rates and a sustained proliferation. Moreover, as expected, the addition of HA into the PLA matrix contributed to mimicking a bone extracellular matrix, leading to positive effects on the pre-osteoblast osteogenic differentiation. In addition, a limited inflammatory response was also observed. Overall, the results suggest the great potential of the newly developed 3D-printed composite materials as suitable candidates for bone tissue engineering applications.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biomimetics"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/bios14010052","title":["Exploring the Hidden Complexity: Entropy Analysis in Pulse Oximetry of Female Athletes"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2800-150X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ana M.","family":"Cabanas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1, Arica 1010069, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2486-1628","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Macarena","family":"Fuentes-Guajardo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de Tecnolog\u00eda M\u00e9dica, Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1, Arica 1010069, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-3540-2062","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicolas","family":"S\u00e1ez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1, Arica 1010069, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-5972-496X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Davidson D.","family":"Catal\u00e1n","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1, Arica 1010069, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-0529-867X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Patricio O.","family":"Collao-Caiconte","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Direcci\u00f3n de Gesti\u00f3n Digital y Transparencia, Universidad de Tarapac\u00e1, Arica 1000007, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1431-8493","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pilar","family":"Mart\u00edn-Escudero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Medical School of Sport Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This study examines the relationship between physiological complexity, as measured by Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), and fitness levels in female athletes.

The first model determines image regions that are suitable for counting blood cells, and the second model is an instance segmentation model that detects the cells in the determined image regions. The region selection model achieves up to 97.3% in terms of F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall), and the instance segmentation model achieves up to 90.7% in terms of mean average precision.

As the core equipment in the process of coal mining, the intelligence level of shearers directly affects the safety production and mining efficiency of coal mines. Coal and rock recognition technology is the core technology used to realize the intelligentization of shearers, which is an urgent technical problem to be solved in the field of coal mining. In this paper, coal seam images, rock stratum images, and coal\u2013rock mixed-layer images of a coal mining area are taken as the research object, and key technologies such as the construction of a sample image library, classification and recognition, and semantic segmentation are studied by using the relevant theoretical knowledge of artificial neural network models. Firstly, the BP neural network is used to classify and identify coal seam images, rock stratum images, and coal\u2013rock mixed-layer images, so as to distinguish which of the current mining targets of a shearer is the coal seam, rock stratum, or coal\u2013rock mixed layer. Because different mining objectives will lead to different working modes of a shearer, it is necessary to maintain normal power to cut coal when encountering a coal seam, to stop working when encountering rock stratum, and to cut coal along the boundary between a coal seam and rock stratum when encountering a coal\u2013rock mixed stratum. Secondly, the DeepLabv3+ model is used to perform semantic segmentation experiments on the coal\u2013rock mixed-layer images. The purpose is to find out the distribution of coal and rocks in the coal\u2013rock mixed layer in the coal mining area, so as to provide technical support for the automatic adjustment height of the shearer. Finally, the research in this paper achieved a 97.16% recognition rate in the classification and recognition experiment of the coal seam images, rock stratum images, and coal\u2013rock mixed-layer images and a 91.2% accuracy in the semantic segmentation experiment of the coal\u2013rock mixed-layer images.

Under physiological conditions, mitochondrial transfer plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis and development. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mitochondria can be transferred from stem cells to pathologically injured cells, leading to mitochondrial functional restoration.

Patients with DPN may encounter symmetric pain or discomfort of the extremes, leading to reduced quality of life and even amputation. The pharmacological management for painful DPN mainly includes antidepressants due to their analgesic effects. Nevertheless, effective therapies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of DPN are lacking.

Methods: Between January 2016 and March 2021, 293 patients from a tertiary hospital in China were retrospectively reviewed as a training set. Another 84 patients were enrolled for model validation from April 2021 to February 2022. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed to select predictors, and a nomogram model was constructed. The calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility of the nomogram were verified. Finally, a web-based online scoring system was created to make the model more practical. Results: The predictors were hypoproteinemia, long-term combined antibiotic use, intubation time, length of mechanical ventilation, and tracheotomy\/intubation. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.937 and 0.925 in the training and validation dataset, respectively, suggesting the model exhibited effective discrimination. The calibration curve demonstrated high consistency with the observed result and the estimated values. Decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically applicable.

The value is evaluated based on the deceleration rate of a falling 4.5 kg weight moving in a vertical guide roller. In Europe, for the assessment of the mechanical efficiency (bearing capacity) of cohesive soils in the pavement subgrade, priority is given to indirect assessment methods especially using the laboratory determination of CBR (Californian Bearing Ratio) and directly through the implementation of a static plate load test (SPLT). This article reports the long-term results of our research in the field of verification and validation of an innovative CIST device, which minimizes the time, space, and economic disadvantages of SPLT. This article presents the results of determining the field of applicability of the CIST device for cohesive soils, the correlation dependencies (CD) of the CBR values determined by the CIST device, and, according to STN 72 1016, the CD of the impact dynamic deformation modulus Evd from the CIV (Clegg Impact Value).

Pakistan is susceptible to natural calamities, such as floods, resulting in millions of people being impacted yearly. It has been demonstrated that flood severity is rising and may continue to escalate in the coming years because of climate change-induced changes in monsoon precipitation in the country. Given the country\u2019s exposure to flooding, it is essential to assess the vulnerability to floods to prepare for and mitigate their impact in Pakistan. This study provides a new conceptual framework for assessing flood risk and vulnerability in Charsadda, a flood-prone district in Pakistan. It evaluates the vulnerability of settlements to floods based on four indicators: population density, the average gross domestic product (GDP) of land, the distance between settlements and rivers, and land use and cover (LULC). The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique was integrated with the geographical information system (GIS) to assess the level of vulnerability to floods in the study area. The results reveal a higher degree of vulnerability to floods in the region. The spatial pattern of vulnerable areas reveals a significant connection between high-risk flood areas and densely populated areas during different flood seasons. The results further reveal that more than 60% of the area is arable land and is highly susceptible to flood. The population and their land-use setup show high and extremely high values of vulnerability in the normalized threshold of 0.3\u20130.4, respectively. The study provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the chosen indicators, evaluation methods, and results, making this a valuable contribution to the field of flood vulnerability assessment.

While most ARIA is asymptomatic, some patients can develop headache, confusion, nausea, dizziness, seizures and in rare cases death. By analyzing lecanemab, aducanumab, gantenerumab, donanemab, and bapineuzumab clinical trials; risk factors for developing ARIA can be identified to mitigate some of the ARIA risk. Risk factors for developing ARIA-E are a positive Apo\u03b54 carrier status and prior multiple cerebral microhemorrhages. Risk factors for ARIA-H are age, antithrombotic use, and history of prior strokes. With lecanemab, ARIA-E and ARIA-H were seen at lower rates 12 and 17%, respectively, compared to aducanumab (ARIA-E 35% and ARIA-H 19%) in treated patients. ARIA risk factors have impacted inclusion and exclusion criteria, determining who can receive lecanemab. In some clinics, almost 90% of Alzheimer\u2019s patients are excluded from receiving these new anti-amyloid therapeutics. This review aims to discuss risk factors of ARIA and highlight important areas for further research. With more anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies approved by the Food and Drug Administration, considering patient risk factors for developing ARIA is important to identify to minimize patient\u2019s risk while receiving these new therapies.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Neuroscience"]},{"DOI":"10.3389\/ffgc.2024.1293330","title":["Effects of changing riparian topography on the decline of ecological indicators along the drawdown zones of long rivers in China"],"author":[{"given":"Muhammad","family":"Arif","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Irene","family":"Petrosillo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Li","family":"Changxiao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Riparian topographical features can drive a suite of ecological indicators (EIs) that shape the river ecosystem. The mechanisms that EIs reflect provide several ecosystem services. We know little about the responses of EIs (indicators of plant cover, regeneration, exotics, habitat, erosion, and stressors) to the changing stream-channel width, riparian width, and elevation of the lengthy drawdown zones (upstream, midstream, and downstream) of long rivers. We have discovered that changing topographical characteristics affect riparian buffer areas differently by using a rapid field-based method with 297 transects in inundated regions along the Yangtze River and other 36 linked tributaries in China. Changing stream-channel widths was most effective on downstream EIs and the least effective at midstream.

These results reaffirm the imperative need for studies on regionally dependent riparian areas maintained under the same management strategies regardless of their topographical features. Future policies should be formulated to enhance ecosystem service provision, promoting the sustainable use of extensive river ecosystems while considering EIs. Additionally, these future policies should acknowledge drawdown zone factors within the same river network.

The CO formation was more facile in presence of H2 at a lower bias compared to the pure CO2 stream.

The main goals of the present study were twofold: (1) to investigate the relationships between four identity orientations (personal, relational, public, and collective) and SWB indicators (i.e., life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect); (2) to examine whether the satisfaction and frustration of needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence moderate the relationships between identity orientations and SWB. A final sample consisted of 1,933 adolescents from Serbia (62.2% female), with a mean age of 15.66 years (age range: 14\u201319 years). The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling. Our findings indicate that collective identity orientation appears to be the most influential aspect of identity for adolescent SWB, while public identity orientation has a weak, but robust negative contribution to SWB. Personal and relational identity orientations had limited predictive value in predicting SWB. Satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs play a significant role in predicting adolescent SWB, but do not act as moderators in the relationship between identity orientations and SWB. Our findings suggest that the relationship between self-construal and adolescent SWB does not depend on the basic psychological needs satisfaction and frustration.<\/p>"},{"DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/kgrvd","title":["Cognitive control is task specific: Further evidence against the idea of domain-general conflict adaptation"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-3362-9461","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Daxun","family":"Zhu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiangpeng","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Enwei","family":"Zhao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nazbanou","family":"Nozari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wim","family":"Notebaert","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cv9y106","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Universiteit Gent"}]},{"given":"Senne","family":"Braem","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00cv9y106","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Universiteit Gent"}]}],"abstract":"<p>Adaptive control refers to flexible adjustments in control settings in response to conflicting situations.

While there has been an abundance of evidence for adaptation within and across highly similar tasks, only some recent studies have reported adaptation across highly dissimilar tasks, with some failures to replicate.

While a multimodal assessment approach is recommended to capture the language variability, this is not always possible. Therefore, it is important to gain contextual information about different language assessments to determine which assessment is most appropriate for different research questions. As most current work is based on English-speaking populations, this paper compares three language assessment modalities (standardized assessment, parent survey, and a natural language sample) between English-speaking and Dutch-speaking autistic and neurotypical children. Method: The Mullen Scales of Early Learning, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and a naturalistic language sample were employed to measure language in 100 preschool-aged participants. Correlation analyses and mixed-effect regressions were conducted and Bland-Altman plots were created to examine the similarity between measures. Results: English-speaking and Dutch-speaking parents rated their children\u2019s expressive language higher than their receptive language. The best agreement for between measures was for standardized language and parent-report. Agreement was higher for children with low language scores. Primary language (English vs. Dutch) did not significantly affect the results.Conclusions: For autistic children with low language levels, parent-reported and standardized language measures provide researchers with similar information. Depending on the available time and resources, researchers may choose to use one of these methods. For autistic children with (above) average language abilities however, multiple modalities should be considered to gain a comprehensive understanding of their language abilities across different settings.

Cold War-era queer cultural production is primarily associated with the then-establishing cultural and political agency of sexual minorities in the West. Nonetheless, despite the hiatus of queer movements or public dialogue in state socialist Hungary, there were still plenty of related works produced and circulated in both alternative and official cultural scenes. However, the lack of knowledge about the socialist era queer lives led to a homogenous image of socialist states: the individuals in question are still seen as absent or viewed as mere victims of the system, who had also no access to knowledge on non-normative sexualities. Therefore, artistic production addressing queer themes is either overlooked or interpreted as manifestations of the artists\u2019 personal struggle, which implies an essentialist understanding of queer art, excluding critical or political connotations of the works and oeuvres in question. My aim is not to prove that queer discourse was thriving in state socialist Hungary. Yet, I argue that queer ideas circulated in Europe between the East and West as well as among socialist countries, offering crucial reference points to artists. Through the case study on El Kazovszkij, it is possible to reconstruct a fraction of these examples from the field of literature, film, visual arts, music, etc., which could contribute to the theoretical and methodological approach to further investigate queer lives of socialist and post-socialist East Central Europe (ECE). Beyond the art historical perspectives, the outcome could become a further step in cultural decolonialism and Piotr Piotrowski\u2019s horizontalism to defy the East-West dichotomy within the cultural history of non-normative sexualities.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Ikonotheka"]},{"DOI":"10.3138\/ptc-2023-0033","title":["Barriers and Facilitators to Aerobic Exercise Testing Practices of Physiotherapists in In-Patient Stroke Rehabilitation Settings Across Canada: A Theory-Informed Web-Based Survey"],"author":[{"given":"Jean Michelle","family":"Legasto-Mulvale","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"From the:  Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"Department of Physical Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}]},{"given":"Elizabeth L.","family":"Inness","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"From the:  Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"Department of Physical Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"The KITE Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}]},{"given":"Nancy M.","family":"Salbach","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"From the:  Rehabilitation Sciences Institute, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"Department of Physical Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"The KITE Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background and Purpose:<\/jats:title><jats:p> Stroke best practice guidelines recommend aerobic exercise (AEx) testing once patients post-stroke are medically stable and before initiating AEx training.

The rapid growth in the number of Internet users over the past two decades has increased the need for cyber security. Users have provided new opportunities for attackers to do harm. Limited security budgets leave IoT devices vulnerable and easily hacked to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, with disastrous results. Unfortunately, due to the unique nature of the Internet of Things environment, most security solutions and intrusion detection systems (IDS) cannot be directly adapted to the IoT with acceptable security performance and are vulnerable to various attacks that do not benefit. In this paper we propose an optimal secure defense mechanism for DDoS in IoT network using feature optimization and intrusion detection system (OSD-IDS). In OSD-IDS mechanism, first we introduce an enhanced ResNet architecture for feature extraction which extracts more deep features from given traffic traces. An improved quantum query optimization (IQQO) algorithm for is used feature selection to selects optimal best among multiple features which reduces the data dimensionality issues. The selected features have given to the detection and classification module to classify the traffic traces are affected by intrusion or not. For this, we design a fast and accurate intrusion detection mechanism, named as hybrid deep learning technique which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and diagonal XG boosting (CNN-DigXG) for the fast and accurate intrusion detection in IoT network. Finally, we validate the performance of proposed technique by using different benchmark datasets are BoNeSi-SlowHTTPtest and CIC-DDoS2019. The simulation results of proposed IDS mechanism are compared with the existing state-of-art IDS mechanism and analyze the performance with respects to different statistical measures. The results show that the DDoS detection accuracy of proposed OSD-IDS mechanism is high as 99.476% and 99.078% for BoNeSi-SlowHTTPtest, CICDDoS2019, respectively.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Intelligent &amp; Fuzzy Systems"]},{"DOI":"10.31539\/costing.v7i2.8837","title":["HR Development Perspective On The Economic Growth Of Rural Banks In Indonesia In The Society 5.0 Era"],"author":[{"given":"Sunday Ade","family":"Sitorus","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anton Atno Parluhutan","family":"Sinaga","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>One of the banking businesses in Indonesia is Rural Banks requiring tough human resources (HR) with appropriate competence.

Methods: RESTORE is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, observational registry that captures data from a variety of sources. Results: Recruitment started in September 2018. As of May 23, 2022, data were available for 168 patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. Median (IQR) age at initial SMA diagnosis was 1 (0\u20136) month and at onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion was 3 (1\u201310) months. Eighty patients (47.6%) had two and 70 (41.7%) had three copies of SMN2, and 98 (58.3%) were identified by newborn screening. Infants identified by newborn screening had a lower age at final assessment (mean age 11.5 months) and greater mean final (SD) CHOP INTEND score (57.0 [10.0] points) compared with clinically diagnosed patients (23.1 months; 52.1 [8.0] points).

We found the billboard-style poster was perceived as easier to learn from, more interactive, and better for promoting scientific discovery. This supports the billboard-style poster design for use in scientific poster sessions. Results also suggested that future improvements to billboard-style designs should aim to efficiently communicate study methods in addition to key findings.

OBJECTIVE: The goal was to investigate the scientific use of polyherbal gel in relieving pain and stiffness due to musculoskeletal injuries and improving activities of daily living (ADLs) in industrial workers. METHODS: A pragmatic, single-blinded, randomized control study divided 200 musculoskeletal injury patients into four parallel groups (n\u200a=\u200a50). Groups 1 and 2 were applied polyherbal gel via phonophoresis with therapeutic ultrasound and superficial massage. Groups 3 and 4 received diclofenac diethyl-ammonium 1% gel by phonophoresis and superficial massage. The Global Pain Relief Scale, Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were used to measure pain, stiffness, and ADLs. Data was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test to compare mean\u00b1SD of four independent groups before and after gel application. The confidence interval was 95%, with p\u200a&lt; \u200a0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: The results revealed that polyherbal gel reduced pain (NPRS, WOMAC and Global pain relief scales) more efficiently (p\u22640.000) when applied with phonophoresis as compared to applied with massage and standard diclofenac (p\u22640.005), furthermore, polyherbal gel when applied with phonophoresis showed more efficient results. CONCLUSION: Industrial workers with musculoskeletal injuries benefited from the use of polyherbal gel for pain and inflammation relief. The polyherbal gel is natural, cost-effective, and easy to formulate.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Work"]},{"DOI":"10.32391\/ajtes.v8i1.354","title":["Allergic Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review"],"author":[{"given":"Mehmet","family":"Hoxha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ester","family":"Ndreu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Etleva","family":"Qirko Lolo\u00e7i","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Introduction: Kounis Syndrome was first described in 1991 by Kounis and Zavras as \u201cthe concurrence of chest pain during an allergic reaction, accompanied by clinical laboratory findings of classical angina pectoris caused by inflammatory mediators released during the allergic insult\u201d [1].&#x0D;\nThe mechanism of Kounis Syndrome most likely involves the release of cytokines through mast-cell degranulation, which leads to coronary vasospasm and atheromatous plaque erosion or rupture following the allergic reaction to an allergen.[2]&#x0D;\nThe treatment is specific to acute coronary syndrome and anaphylaxis, with the added complication that the drugs used, while indicated in each of the two disorders separately, may present contradictions when administered jointly in one patient.[3]&#x0D;\nThe purpose of this review is to briefly revise the existing literature regarding its overlooked diagnosis and contradictory joint management of anaphylaxis and acute coronary syndrome.&#x0D;\nWe will conduct a brief review of the current literature on Kounis Syndrome while describing a suspected case of a female patient presented with both anaphylaxis symptoms and angina pectoris.&#x0D;\nConclusions: Kounis syndrome is defined as the co-incidental occurrence of an acute coronary syndrome with hypersensitivity reactions following an allergic reaction.

Under the framework of rate-and-state friction (RSF), it was found that the ratios of a to b parameters control whether earthquakes nucleate as an expanding crack or a fixed length. However, the characteristic slip distance DRS controls the weakening efficiency of fault strength and can influence the nucleation styles as well. Here we investigate the effects of DRS on nucleation styles in the context of fully dynamic seismic cycles by evaluating the evolution of the nucleation zone quantitatively when it accelerates from the tectonic loading rate to seismic slip velocity. A larger a\/b (&amp;gt;0.75) is needed to produce expanding crack nucleation styles for relatively small DRS, which suggests that fixed length nucleation styles may dominate on natural and laboratory faults. Furthermore, we find that when the nucleation site is not in the center of the asperity, the constant weakening rate near 1 induces a more complex nucleation style. We also identify two special nucleation styles: one containing a temporary acceleration phase (foreshock-like) and the other including a failed acceleration phase (twin-like). We conclude that the earthquake nucleation style is strongly controlled by the value of DRS. Future research needs to be cautious when selecting a few representative DRS to study earthquake nucleation as well as foreshock activities. The possible dominance of fixed length nucleation styles also suggests that the minimum size of earthquake rupture may be estimated at the early stage of the nucleation phase.<\/jats:p>"},{"DOI":"10.31223\/x5kq4f","title":["A new structure determination of the magnesium phosphate mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4\u00b7 6H2O)  at 100 K"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-7533-1101","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rebecca","family":"Volkmann","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marie","family":"M\u00fcnchhalfen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Liane","family":"Benning","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The magnesium phosphate mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4\u00b76H2O) is of interest for the recovery of phosphorus from wastewaters and for use as a fertilizer in agriculture, yet its structure is still debated.

In contrast to the previously published struvite structure determined at room temperature, the ammonium groups do not rotate but are locked by three hydrogen bonds to neighboring oxygen atoms.

The scientific novelty of the research lies in applying a specially developed algorithm for linguistic analysis of neoparemias, which takes into account several aspects of studying these units and is aimed at attaining the stated aim. As a result, it was found that the principle of linguistic combinatorics serves as the basis for the formation of German neoparemias about female individuality, which includes such mechanisms of transformation of well-known paroemias as explication, substitution, contamination, combination, as well as well-known paremic models. The gender-systemic aspect of the study of neoparemias consists in identifying gender indicators, i.e., lexical, grammatical and other linguistic means indicating female gender. The method of semantic and cognitive analysis helps us to determine the meanings embedded in new paremiological units by native German speakers. The cognitive-dynamic aspect of the study is aimed at identifying non-traditional attitudes about the criteria of female identity and correlations caused by the new realities of the modern anthropocentric paradigm.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Philology.

This makes group theory a powerful tool in quantum mechanics, when computing molecular properties. For inorganic compounds, the coordination geometry has been estimated as idealized polyhedra of high symmetry, which through ligand field theory provides predictive capabilities. However, real samples rarely have ideal symmetry, and even though continuous symmetry measures can be used to evaluate deviation form ideal symmetry, this often fails for lanthanide(III) complexes with high coordination numbers and no obvious principal axis. In lanthanide complexes, the unique electronic structures and the associated properties are intricately tied to the symmetry around the lanthanide center. Robust methodologies to evaluate and estimate point group symmetry is therefore instrumental for building structure property relationships. Here, we have demonstrated an algorithmic approach that determines the principal axis, and computes a deviation from ideal symmetry. This approach is based on the continuous symmetry measures and evaluates deviations from ideal symmetry for each symmetry operation in all relevant point groups. To demonstrate the methodology we have investigated the structure and symmetry of 8 and 9 coordinated lanthanide(III) aqua complexes, and correlated the luminescence from 3 europium(III) crystals to their actual symmetry.

Recent research has shown that manipulating mitochondria, the organelles critical for energy metabolism in tumor cells, can increase the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy and trigger apoptosis in tumor cells. However, there is currently insufficient research and effective methods to exploit mitochondrial damage to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and improve the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy. In this study, we present a novel nanomedicine delivery and therapeutic system called PyroFPSH, which utilizes a nanozymes-modified metal-organic framework as a carrier. PyroFPSH exhibits remarkable multienzyme-like activities, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) mimicry, allowing it to overcome apoptosis resistance, reduce endogenous glutathione levels, and continuously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, PyroFPSH can serve as a carrier for the targeted delivery of sulfasalazine, a drug that can induce mitochondrial depolarization in tumor cells, thereby reducing oxygen consumption and energy supply in the mitochondria of tumor cells and weakening resistance to other synergistic treatment approaches. Our experimental results highlight the potential of PyroFPSH as a versatile nanoplatform in cancer treatment. This study expands the biomedical applications of nanomaterials as platforms and enables the integration of various novel therapeutic strategies to synergistically improve tumor therapy. It deepens our understanding of multienzyme-mimicking active nanocarriers and mitochondrial damage through photodynamic therapy. Future research can further explore the potential of PyroFPSH in clinical cancer treatment and improve its drug loading capacity, biocompatibility and targeting specificity. In summary, PyroFPSH represents a promising therapeutic approach that can provide new insights and possibilities for cancer treatment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology"]},{"DOI":"10.33774\/apsa-2024-52npp","title":["Zones of Dispossession: Explaining Black Politics During Oakland\u2019s Gentrification"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-6607-4416","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Saranyan","family":"Uthayakumar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Southern California"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The theories of spatiotemporal dispossession have proposed a mechanism for how capital can flow out of areas that become \u2018dispossessed\u2019 and concentrate capital in areas of accumulation that are defined as gentrified or beautified (Harvey 2005, 2010, 2018).

The Hortob\u00e1gy National Park\u2014the Puszta was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a cultural landscape in 1999. The park\u2019s outstanding importance is due to the predominantly non-arboreal steppe vegetation, home to a unique bird fauna, and alkaline and chernozem soils with a complex, mosaic-like spatial structure. In addition, the landscape of Hortob\u00e1gy has a pastoral history stretching back thousands of years. Several hypotheses have been put forward that suggest that the alkaline soils and the habitats that cover them were formed as a result of human activities related to river regulation that began in the second half of the 19th century. However, paleoecological and paleobiological studies over the last 30\u201340 years have pointed to the natural origin of the alkaline steppes, dating back to the end of the Ice Age. For thousands of years, human activities, in particular, grazing by domestic animals, hardly influenced the natural evolution of the area. The drainage of marshy and flooded areas began in the 19th century, as well as the introduction of more and more intensive agriculture, had a significant impact on the landscape. This paper aims to describe the past natural development of this special alkaline steppe ecosystem, with particular reference to the impacts of past and present human activities, including conservation measures.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Diversity"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/coatings14010130","title":["Shoulder-Restricted Friction Deposition for Aluminum Alloy Coatings on Titanium Alloys"],"author":[{"given":"Yuanhang","family":"Guo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"AVIC Manufacturing Technology Institute, Beijing 100024, China"}]},{"given":"Jihong","family":"Dong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"AVIC Manufacturing Technology Institute, Beijing 100024, China"}]},{"given":"Zongliang","family":"Lv","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China"}]},{"given":"Yuming","family":"Xie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China"},{"name":"Zhengzhou Research Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Zhengzhou 450046, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0682-5321","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yongxian","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China"},{"name":"Zhengzhou Research Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Zhengzhou 450046, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2392-2740","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xiangchen","family":"Meng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China"},{"name":"Zhengzhou Research Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology, Zhengzhou 450046, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In order to solve the problem of a thin deposition layer on the titanium alloy in the traditional friction surfacing process of dissimilar Ti\/Al metals, new shoulder-restricted friction deposition (SRFD) equipment was successfully developed by introducing a restricted shoulder.

The morphologies of the fabricated samples were obtained using a scanning electron microscopy, which yielded information on the crystal size and sample surface before and after corrosion tests. X-ray diffraction was employed for the structural characterization of the as-deposited films, and vibrational spectroscopy was used to verify the corrosion products. The corrosion behaviors of the Cu\u2013Ni and Cu\u2013Ni\u2013Al samples were examined using electrochemical polarization and cyclic corrosion tests. The Al co-deposited samples showed a refined crystal size as compared to the Cu\u2013Ni sample, suggesting that they are more susceptible to the formation of a passivation film. The corrosion current density of the Cu\u2013Ni\u2013Al was reduced, and the corrosion potential was lower than that without Al content. The negative shift in the corrosion potential of the Al-containing samples indicates that the Al2O3 film suppressed the cathodic reaction, resulting in a decrease in the corrosion rate. These results are consistent with the cyclic corrosion test results, in which no pitting corrosion is observed in the Cu\u2013Ni\u2013Al sample.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Coatings"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/diagnostics14020219","title":["Post-COVID-19 Vaccination Myocarditis: A Histopathologic Study on a Monocentric Series of Six Cases"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9531-7286","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hyo-Suk","family":"Ahn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3330-8725","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuran","family":"Ahn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2153-2810","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jaehyuk","family":"Jang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2754-8116","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Seonghyun","family":"Bu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4833-4440","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sungmin","family":"Lim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Chanjoon","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Jong-Min","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uijeongbu St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Catholic Research Institute for Intractable Cardiovascular Disease (CRID), College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Kyungji","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Midwest International Research Institute, Midwest University, 851 Parr Rd., Wentzville, MO 63385, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1908-9696","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kyung-Jin","family":"Seo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Hospital Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Many reports on the development of myocarditis following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination (PCVM) have emerged.

Polyphenols in wine not only shape their organoleptic characteristics but also significantly contribute to the positive impact that this beverage has on human health. However, during the winemaking process, the total polyphenol content is substantially reduced due to the adsorption onto yeast wall polymers and subsequent lees separation. Despite this, limited information is available regarding the influence of the yeast starter strain on the polyphenolic profile of wine. To address this issue, a population consisting of 136 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was analyzed to identify those with a diminished ability to adsorb polyphenols. Firstly, the reduction in concentration of polyphenolic compounds associated to each strain was studied by assaying Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) in the wines produced by micro-scale must fermentation. A total of 29 strains exhibiting a TPC and TEAC reduction \u2264 50%, when compared to that detected in the utilized grape must were identified and the nine most-promising strains were further validated by larger-scale vinification. Physico-chemical analyses of the resulting wines led to the identification of four strains, namely ITEM6920, ITEM9500, ITEM9507 and ITEM9508 which showed, compared to the control wine, a TPC and TEAC reduction \u2264 20 in the produced wines. They were denoted by a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increased amount of anthocyanin, quercetin and trans-coutaric acid, minimal volatile acidity (&lt;0.2 g\/L), absence of undesirable metabolites and a well-balanced volatile profile. As far as we know, this investigation represents the first clonal selection of yeast strains aimed at the identifying \u201cfunctional\u201d fermentation starters, thereby enabling the production of regional wines with enriched polyphenolic content.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Foods"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/foods13020322","title":["Structural Properties of Casein Micelles with Adjusted Micellar Calcium Phosphate Content"],"author":[{"given":"Elaheh","family":"Ahmadi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Advanced Food Systems Research Unit, Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, College of Sport, Health and Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1235-6365","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tatijana","family":"Markoska","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Advanced Food Systems Research Unit, Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, College of Sport, Health and Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4142-9359","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thom","family":"Huppertz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Advanced Food Systems Research Unit, Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, College of Sport, Health and Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia"},{"name":"FrieslandCampina, 3818 LE Amersfoort, The Netherlands"},{"name":"Food Quality and Design Group, Wageningen University and Research, 6708 WG Wageningen, The Netherlands"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1395-7349","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Todor","family":"Vasiljevic","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Advanced Food Systems Research Unit, Institute for Sustainable Industries and Liveable Cities, College of Sport, Health and Engineering, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC 3001, Australia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Micellar calcium phosphate (MCP) content of skim milk was modified by pH adjustment followed by dialysis.

Wi-Fi is positioned as a particularly advantageous sensing medium, due to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi-enabled devices in a more connected world. Although Wi-Fi-based sensing using Channel State Information (CSI) has shown promise, existing sensing systems commonly configure dedicated transmitters to generate packets for sensing. These dedicated transmitters substantially increase the energy requirements of Wi-Fi sensing systems, and hence there is a need for understanding how ambient transmissions from nearby Wi-Fi devices can be leveraged instead. This paper explores the potential of Wi-Fi-based sensing using CSI derived from ambient transmissions of Wi-Fi devices. We demonstrate that CSI sensing accuracy is dependent on the underlying traffic type and the Wi-Fi transceiver architecture, and that control packets yield more robust CSI than payload packets. We also show that traffic containing upload data is more suitable for human occupancy counting, using the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of CSI. We further demonstrate that multiple spatially diverse streams of Wi-Fi CSI can be combined for sensing to an accuracy of 99%. The experimental study highlights the importance of training Wi-Fi sensing systems for multiple transmission sources to improve accuracy.

It has also brought about abrupt disruptions to the entire university system, whose students form a crucial segment of society. The pandemic\u2019s effects on student education and well-being have been particularly significant. One of the primary consequences has been a drastic reduction in physical activity levels among students, leading to mental and physical health problems. Despite the rapid growth in the literature exploring student experiences during the pandemic, there is a paucity of research on how this decline in physical activity has affected the five strengths of the healthy student: optimism, self-efficacy, resilience, engagement, and hope. Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to examine the relationship between physical activity levels and the five strengths of the healthy student at two different time points (pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19) through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Healthy Student Questionnaire. The study involved 897 participants, with 290 participating in the pre-COVID-19 phase and 607 participating in the COVID-19 phase. The results revealed significant differences in the five strengths between the two periods. Students who engaged in physical activity exhibited significantly higher optimism scores in the pre-COVID-19 phase. During the COVID-19 phase, physically active students demonstrated significantly higher scores in optimism, resilience, and self-efficacy. These findings provide clear guidance for university administrators seeking to enhance student well-being in a post-pandemic world and in the face of future disruptions. Universities should consider implementing physical exercise programs for their students to promote psychosocial well-being and provide training and resources to equip faculty members with new skills to better understand and support students\u2019 perceptions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25021229","title":["Salt-Induced Early Changes in Photosynthesis Activity Caused by Root-to-Shoot Signaling in Potato"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5690-6125","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna","family":"Pecherina","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biophysics, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"given":"Anastasia","family":"Dimitrieva","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biophysics, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"given":"Maxim","family":"Mudrilov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biophysics, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3898-321X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maria","family":"Ladeynova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biophysics, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"given":"Daria","family":"Zanegina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4850-9020","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna","family":"Brilkina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3726-5577","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vladimir","family":"Vodeneev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biophysics, National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, 23 Gagarin Avenue, 603022 Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Salinity is one of the most dangerous types of stress in agriculture. Acting on the root, salinity causes changes in physiological processes in the shoot, especially photosynthesis, which is crucial for plant productivity. In our study, we used potato plants, the most important crop, to investigate the role of salt-induced signals in changes in photosynthesis activity. We found a salt-induced polyphasic decrease in photosynthesis activity, and the earliest phase started several minutes after salt addition. We found that salt addition triggered rapid hydraulic and calcium waves from root to shoot, which occurred earlier than the first phase of the photosynthesis response. The inhibition of calcium signals by lanthanum decreased with the formation of rapid changes in photosynthesis. In addition to this, a comparison of the characteristic times of signal propagation and the formation of a response revealed the role of calcium waves in the modulation of rapid changes in photosynthesis. Calcium waves are activated by the ionic component of salinity. The salt-induced decrease in transpiration corresponds in time to the second phase of the photosynthetic response, and it can be the cause of this change. The accumulation of sodium in the leaves occurs a few hours after salt addition, and it can be the cause of the long-term suppression of photosynthesis. Thus, salinity modulates photosynthetic activity in plants in different ways: both through the activation of rapid distant signals and by reducing the water input and sodium accumulation.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Molecular Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/e26010085","title":["Identification of Critical Links Based on Electrical Betweenness and Neighborhood Similarity in Cyber-Physical Power Systems"],"author":[{"given":"Jiuling","family":"Dong","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China"}]},{"given":"Zilong","family":"Song","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China"}]},{"given":"Yuanshuo","family":"Zheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Information Science and Technology, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571158, China"}]},{"given":"Jingtang","family":"Luo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Grid Sichuan Economic Research Institute, Chengdu 610041, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3293-6121","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Min","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5102-6962","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xiaolong","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1785-4024","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hongbing","family":"Ma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Identifying critical links is of great importance for ensuring the safety of the cyber-physical power system.

An identification method based on electrical betweenness centrality and neighborhood similarity is proposed to consider the internal power flow dynamic influence existing in multi-neighborhood nodes and the topological structure interdependence between power nodes and communication nodes. Firstly, for the power network, the electrical topological overlap is proposed to quantify the vulnerability of the links. This approach comprehensively considers the local contribution of neighborhood nodes, power transmission characteristics, generator capacity, and load. Secondly, in communication networks, effective distance closeness centrality is defined to evaluate the importance of communication links, simultaneously taking into account factors such as the information equipment function and spatial relationships. Next, under the influence of coupled factors, a comprehensive model is constructed based on the dependency relationships between information flow and energy flow to more accurately assess the critical links in the power network.

For plateletcrit (PCT, p = 0.0600), the eosinophil percentage (EOS, p = 0.0880) showed a tendency to be lower, while the monocyte (MONO) and large unstained cells (LUC) amounts were increased in both groups (p &lt; 0.05). Albumin and glucose levels were lower in the HTHH group (p &lt; 0.05). The gene expressions of heat shock proteins 70 and 90 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher in the ACT group (HTHH, p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that ACT supplementation improved productivity, physiological indicators, blood characteristics, and gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of early lactating Holstein cows under heat-stress conditions. In particular, ACT supplementation objectively relieved stress in these animals, suggesting that L-tryptophan has potential as a viable solution for combating heat-stress-induced effects on the cattle in dairy farming.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Molecular Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25021206","title":["Sophoridine Counteracts Obesity via Src-Mediated Inhibition of VEGFR Expression and PI3K\/AKT Phosphorylation"],"author":[{"given":"Jingchun","family":"Sun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"given":"Xiaoting","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"given":"Yulin","family":"He","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"given":"Xuekai","family":"Tian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"given":"Tiantian","family":"Yuan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2003-979X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gongshe","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]},{"given":"Taiyong","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Laboratory of Animal Fat Deposition & Muscle Development, College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Sophoridine (SRP) is a natural quinolizidine alkaloid found in many traditional Chinese herbs, though its effect on adipose tissue is unclear.

EV battery packs undergo second-life application after first-life retirement, with SoH measurements taken before redeployment. However, the impact of the root cause of degradation on second-life performance remains unknown. Hence, the question remains whether it is necessary to have more than a simple measure of state of health (SoH) before redeployment. This article presents experimental data to investigate this. As part of the experiment, a group of cells at around 80% SoH, representing retired EV batteries, were cycled using a representative second-life duty cycle. Cells with a similar root cause of degradation in the first life (100\u201380% SoH) exhibited the same degradation rate in second life after being cycled with the same duty cycle during the second life. When the root cause of degradation in the first life is different, the degradation rate in the second life may not be the same. These findings suggest that the root cause of a cell\u2019s first-life degradation impacts how it degrades in its second life. Postmortem analysis (photographic and SEM images) reveals the similar physical condition of negative electrodes which have similar degradation rates in their second life cycle. This demonstrates that cells with a similar first life SoH and root cause of degradation indeed experience a similar life during their second life. The experimental results, along with the subsequent postmortem analysis, suggest that relying solely on SoH assessment is insufficient. It is crucial to take into account the root causes of cell degradation before redeployment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Energies"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/electronics13020422","title":["Blockchain Innovations, Applications, and Future Prospects"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6503-6739","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hamed","family":"Taherdoost","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Arts, Communications and Social Sciences, University Canada West, Vancouver, BC V6B 1V9, Canada"},{"name":"Research and Development Department, Hamta Business Corporation, Vancouver, BC V6E 1C9, Canada"},{"name":"Q Minded|Quark Minded Technology Inc., Vancouver, BC V6E 1C9, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This Special Issue delves into the diverse applications of blockchain technology, spanning topics including democratic elections, business models, secure data storage, and large-scale ICT security [...]<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Electronics"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/heritage7010023","title":["Multi-Feature Uncertainty Analysis for Urban-Scale Hypothetical 3D Reconstructions: Piazza delle Erbe Case Study"],"author":[{"given":"Fabrizio Ivan","family":"Apollonio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Architecture, University of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy"}]},{"given":"Federico","family":"Fallavollita","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Architecture, University of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy"}]},{"given":"Riccardo","family":"Foschi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Architecture, University of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8548-7887","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rosa","family":"Smurra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Architecture, University of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>For the hypothetical reconstruction of architectural heritage, there are still no scientific standards of reference concerning their sharing and documentation.

We stained the mitochondrial matrix with fluorescent dyes sensitive to K+, pH, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and membrane potential in plasma membrane-permeabilized C6 cells and isolated mitochondria from C6 cells. Fluorescence microscopy facilitated the accurate measurement of fluorescence intensity inside and outside the matrix. Increasing extramitochondrial K+ concentration from 2 mM to 127 mM led to a reduction in matrix pH and a decrease in the generation of highly reactive ROS. In addition, elevated K+ levels electrically polarized the inner membrane of the mitochondria and promoted efficient ATP synthesis via FoF1-ATPase. Introducing protons (H+) into the matrix through phosphate addition led to further mitochondrial polarization, and this effect was more pronounced in the presence of K+. K+ at high concentrations, reaching sub-hundred millimolar levels, increased H+ concentration within the matrix, suppressing ROS generation and boosting ATP synthesis.

To assess the role of m6A modifications during copper-induced oxidative stress responses, m6A-IP-seq was performed in Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to high levels of copper sulfate. This analysis revealed large-scale shifts in this modification on the transcripts most relevant for oxidative stress. This altered epitranscriptomic mark is known to influence transcript abundance and translation; therefore we scrutinized these possibilities. We found an increased abundance of copper-enriched m6A-containing transcripts. Similarly, we also found increased ribosome occupancy of copper-enriched m6A-containing transcripts, specifically those encoding proteins involved with stress responses relevant to oxidative stressors. Furthermore, the significance of the m6A epitranscriptome on plant oxidative stress tolerance was uncovered by assessing germination and seedling development of the mta (N6-methyladenosine RNA methyltransferase A mutant complemented with ABI3:MTA) mutant exposed to high copper treatment. These analyses suggested hypersensitivity of the mta mutant compared to the wild-type plants in response to copper-induced oxidative stress.

To overcome the consequences of improper replication control, malignant cells frequently inactivate parts of their DNA damage response (DDR) pathways (the ATM-CHK2-p53 pathway), while relying on other pathways which help to maintain replication fork stability (ATR-CHK1). This creates a dependency on the remaining DDR pathways, vulnerability to further destabilization of replication and synthetic lethality of DDR inhibitors with common oncogenic alterations such as mutations of TP53, RB1, ATM, amplifications of MYC, CCNE1 and others. The response to RS is normally limited by coordination of cell cycle, transcription and replication.

Method: A quantitative, observational, longitudinal, and analytical study was conducted with 121 participants diagnosed with onco-hematological cancer who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between October 2017 and September 2019, with a 2-year post-transplantation follow-up, of whom only 39 completed the study. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2014Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) questionnaire and its subscales, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2014General (FACT-BMT) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI), developed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) and validated for Spain, were used to assess quality of life. Result: The average age for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 54 years, with a majority of male participants. The evaluation of quality of life showed a decrease at the time of hospital discharge, followed by a progressive improvement up to one year after the transplantation. There was a significant difference in the quality of life questionnaire scores between both sexes during all stages of the research, with higher scores in male participants. The length of hospital stay significantly affected patients\u2019 physical and functional well-being, and marital status was related to differences in the perception of quality of life. Conclusions: Despite the initial decrease in quality of life for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, levels of quality of life similar to baseline are regained one year after the transplantation. Sociodemographic variables are related to how these patients perceive their quality of life. However, further studies with a larger sample size are needed for more precise results.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nursing Reports"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/s24020630","title":["Assessment of Directional\u2013Hemispherical Reflectance of Tablets with Cefuroxime during Storage under Elevated Temperature and Ultraviolet Radiation"],"author":[{"given":"Micha\u0142","family":"Meisner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Doctoral School, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland"},{"name":"Department of Basic Biomedical Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0002-8591","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Beata","family":"Sarecka-Hujar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Basic Biomedical Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Environmental conditions can lead to changes in the physical and chemical structures of drug products.

REBCO (RE: rare earth) bulk superconductors can be used as strong magnets by magnetizing them, but they require large bulk sizes for their application. Although the superconducting joint presents a viable solution, many possibilities for property improvement remain, such as property degradation, depending on the joining direction. By varying the joining thermal conditions and confirming the elemental distribution, magnetization properties near the joined part and the effects of these on the joining properties are clarified, and a method for fabricating high-performance joined samples is obtained. Microstructure segregation was rarely observed at the center of the joined part regardless of the joining direction, and the superconducting properties were negligible and small. The Jc-B results are almost identical to those of the GdBCO matrix at a low field, confirming that the joined part minimally interferes with the superconducting current. Furthermore, by lowering the maximum temperature, shortening the holding time at the maximum temperature, and increasing the cooling rate, the region of mutual solid solution was reduced, and the Jc-B under the self-magnetic field was enhanced. These results contribute to the development of the superconducting joining method, a critical aspect of larger bulk superconductors.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Materials"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25021244","title":["An ESR1-Related Gene Signature Identifies Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Imputed Susceptibility to Endocrine Therapy"],"author":[{"given":"Firas","family":"Almouhanna","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3493-1711","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jochen","family":"Hess","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany"},{"name":"Research Group Molecular Mechanisms of Head and Neck Tumors, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. New personalized treatment strategies represent an unmet medical need to improve the overall survival and the quality of life of patients, which are often limited by the toxicity of established multimodal treatment protocols. Several studies have reported an increased expression of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in HNSCC, but its potential role in the disease outcome of these tumors remains elusive. Using an integrative analysis of multiomics and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-HNSC, we established a prognostic risk model based on an ESR1-related 25-gene set. The prognostic value was confirmed in an independent cohort of HNSCC and other solid tumors from TCGA. Finally, we performed in silico drug sensitivity modeling to explore potential vulnerabilities for both risk groups. This approach predicted a higher sensitivity for HNSCC, with prominent ESR1 pathway activity under treatment with specific estrogen receptor modulators. In conclusion, our data confirm the involvement of ESR1-related pathway activity in the progression of a defined subset of HNSCC, provide compelling evidence that these tumors share a specific vulnerability to endocrine therapy, and pave the way for preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of this new therapeutic option.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Molecular Sciences"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/ma17020476","title":["Low-Cyclic Reversed Loading Tests on Full-Scale Precast Concrete Composite Wall Connected by Tooth Groove and Grouted Sleeve"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6371-3353","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xiaoyong","family":"Luo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Civil Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410075, China"},{"name":"Engineering Technology Research Center for Prefabricated Construction Industrialization of Hunan Province, Changsha 410075, China"}]},{"given":"Qi","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Civil Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410075, China"}]},{"given":"Chao","family":"Deng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Civil Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410075, China"}]},{"given":"Wangcheng","family":"Luo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Civil Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410075, China"}]},{"given":"Yang","family":"He","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Civil Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410075, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In this paper, a novel precast concrete composite wall connected by tooth groove and grouted sleeve was introduced, which is produced in factories by means of structure-insulation integrated prefabrication, and the prefabrication and assembly process were presented minutely.

The research results showed that under the vertical axial load and low-cyclic reversed load, the distributed reinforcements in the wall panel only played a structural role, while the connecting reinforcements at horizontal joints can always effectively transfer stress without bond failure, and the tooth groove and grouted sleeve connection performance was reliable.

The high-fat (HF) diet damaged insulin sensitivity and increased triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and liver lipid deposition. STZ increased blood glucose and liver fibrosis with less effects on blood lipids or liver lipid deposition. The combination of DIO and STZ treatments led to significant liver lipid deposition and fibrosis. Female mice showed delayed body weight gain on HF diet and resisted STZ-induced hyperglycemia. However, once they developed DIO, which occurs around 26 weeks of HF diet, the female mice were prone to STZ-induced hyperglycemia. In hindlimb ischemia, male mice in the DIO-STZ group showed significantly worse neovascularization compared with DIO or STZ groups. The DIO-STZ females showed significantly worse recovery than the DIO-STZ males. Our observations suggest that DIO-STZ is a plausible model for studying metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in obesity and diabetes.

Among these, the Mittag-Leffler-type functions are the most popular and frequently used in fractional calculus. Naturally, these also include all \u201cClassical Special Functions\u201d of the class of the Meijer\u2019s G- and pFq-functions, orthogonal polynomials and many elementary functions. However, it so happened that almost simultaneously with the appearance of the Mittag-Leffler function, another \u201cfractionalized\u201d variant of the exponential function was introduced by Le Roy, and in recent years, several authors have extended this special function and mentioned its applications. Then, we introduced a general class of so-called (multi-index) Le Roy-type functions, and observed that they fall in an \u201cExtended Class of SF of FC\u201d. This includes the I-functions of Rathie and, in particular, the H\u00af-functions of Inayat-Hussain, studied also by Buschman and Srivastava and by other authors. These functions initially arose in the theory of the Feynman integrals in statistical physics, but also include some important special functions that are well known in math, like the polylogarithms, Riemann Zeta functions, some famous polynomials and number sequences, etc. The I- and H\u00af-functions are introduced by Mellin\u2013Barnes-type integral representations involving multi-valued fractional order powers of \u0393-functions with a lot of singularities that are branch points. Here, we present briefly some preliminaries on the theory of these functions, and then our ideas and results as to how the considered Le Roy-type functions can be presented in their terms. Next, we also introduce Gelfond\u2013Leontiev generalized operators of differentiation and integration for which the Le Roy-type functions are eigenfunctions. As shown, these \u201cgeneralized integrations\u201d can be extended as kinds of generalized operators of fractional integration, and are also compositions of \u201cLe Roy type\u201d Erd\u00e9lyi\u2013Kober integrals. A close analogy appears with the Generalized Fractional Calculus with H- and G-kernel functions, thus leading the way to its further development.

Obstacles preventing greater clinical success are rapid hepatic elimination and limited viral replication and spread within the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesised that higher intratumoural levels of the virus could be achieved by altering cellular epigenetic regulation. Here we report on the screening of an enriched epigenetics small molecule library and validation of six compounds that increased viral gene expression and replication. The greatest effects were observed with three epigenetic inhibitors targeting bromodomain (BRD)-containing proteins. Specifically, BRD4 inhibitors enhanced the efficacy of Ad5 wild type, Ad\u2206\u2206, and Ad-3\u2206-A20T in 3-dimensional co-culture models of PDAC and in vivo xenografts. RNAseq analysis demonstrated that the inhibitors increased viral E1A expression, altered expression of cell cycle regulators and inflammatory factors, and attenuated expression levels of tumour cell oncogenes such as c-Myc and Myb.

It was observed that hetero-benzylic positions of the pyridine, thiophene and furan derivatives were stable after Wittig olefination. Similarly, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached to N-heterocycles (indole and pyrrole derivatives) directly enhanced the stability of the benzylic position during and after Wittig olefination, resulting in the formation of stable alkenes.

The Jesuits recognized art\u2019s potential in their missionary efforts. The article examines the varied responses of Chinese literati to Western art theories in the 17th and 18th centuries, and how Jesuit-introduced artistic concepts were assimilated within different Chinese contexts. It also investigates how Western art merged into Chinese culture, noting the linguistic integration of concepts like chiaroscuro. In Ricci\u2019s time, Western art intrigued the Chinese, but deep acceptance and conceptual transformation were limited. The assimilation of Western techniques was not as widespread as expected. In the 18th century, due to restrictions on Christianity, the religious role of painting diminished. Castiglione\u2019s hybrid style, though influential in the Qing court, faced challenges in gaining cultural acceptance from the Han literati, leading to more criticism than in Ricci\u2019s era. Despite these challenges and varying receptions, the contributions of Ricci and Castiglione to the Sino\u2013Western art exchange are significant, reflecting the complex interplay of art, religion, and cultural dynamics across these periods.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Religions"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/medicina60010175","title":["Effectiveness of Acupotomy Combined with Epidural Steroid Injection for Lumbosacral Radiculopathy: A Randomized Controlled Pragmatic Pilot Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8387-2485","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jin-Hyun","family":"Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Integrative Medicine, International St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon 22711, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0406-7814","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sang-Hyun","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Hae Sun","family":"Suh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Department of Regulatory Science, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Institute of Regulatory Innovation through Science, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Man-Suk","family":"Hwang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Korean Medicine Rehabilitation, Spine and Joint Center, Pusan National University Korean Medicine Hospital, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Third Division of Clinical Medicine, School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan 50612, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Semin","family":"Jang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Regulatory Science, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"},{"name":"Institute of Regulatory Innovation through Science, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8852-8816","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sooil","family":"Choi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, International St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon 22711, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Young-Soo","family":"Lim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, International St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon 22711, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Sang Hyun","family":"Byun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"SAGAJEONG Pain and Korean Medicine Clinic, Seoul 02238, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2695-9589","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sang-Hoon","family":"Yoon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Applied Korean Medicine, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8798-7578","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sukhee","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, International St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon 22711, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6803-5483","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tae-Yong","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Integrative Medicine, International St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon 22711, Republic of Korea"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background and Objectives: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of acupotomy combined with epidural steroid injection (ESI) in lumbosacral radiculopathy and examine its feasibility for the main study. Materials and Methods: This randomized, controlled, two-arm, parallel, assessor-blinded, pragmatic study included 50 patients with severe lumbosacral radiculopathy who had insufficient improvement after an ESI. Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) into a combined treatment (acupotomy + ESI, experimental) and an ESI single treatment (control) group. Both groups underwent a total of two ESIs once every 2 weeks; the experimental group received eight additional acupotomy treatments twice a week for 4 weeks. Types of ESI included interlaminar, transforaminal, and caudal approaches. Drugs used in ESI comprised a 5\u201310 mL mixture of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (2.5 mg), mepivacaine (0.3%), and hyaluronidase (1500 IU). The primary outcome was the difference in changes from baseline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores between the groups at weeks 4 and 8. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated to evaluate the cost-effectiveness between the groups. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at all visits. Results: Mean ODI scores for the experimental and control groups were \u22129.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \u221212.71, \u22126.17) and \u22122.16 (95% CI: \u22125.01, 0.69) at week 4, and \u22129.04 (95% CI: \u221212.09, \u22125.99) and \u22124.76 (95% CI: \u22127.68, \u22121.84) at week 8, respectively. The difference in ODI score changes was significant between the groups at week 4 (p = 0.0021). The ICUR of the experimental group versus the control group was as economical as 18,267,754 won\/quality-adjusted life years. No serious AEs were observed. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupotomy combined with ESI for lumbosacral radiculopathy and its feasibility for a full-scale study.

Accurate representation of the economic development status and spillover effects of cities within an urban agglomeration is the foundation of and an effective approach for promoting the coordinated development of that agglomeration. However, current studies of economic spillovers tend to focus on urban agglomerations as a whole, and there is a lack of scrutiny and validation of research data. Therefore, this study proposes a framework for detecting economic spillover effects within an urban agglomeration based on a prolonged night-time light dataset. Firstly, we explored the most suitable night-time light index to characterize the economic status. Then, we used this index to construct the economic network and hierarchical structure of the urban agglomeration. Finally, we explored the heterogeneity of spillover effects under the hierarchical structure. The results of a case study in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration show that (1) the total night-time light in built-up areas (BNTL) has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient with GDP, which is 0.82; (2) there is an obvious hierarchical structure within the PRD; (3) there are significant and sustained economic spillover effects among the core cities, with Guangzhou\u2013Foshan and Shenzhen\u2013Dongguan having more obvious spillover effects; and (4) the economic spillover effects within the three metropolitan areas have different characteristics. The Guangzhou\u2013Foshan\u2013Zhaoqing metropolitan area is closely linked, to apparent differences in the pace of spillover effects. The Shenzhen\u2013Dongguan\u2013Huizhou metropolitan area has strong close linkages, with strong synchronization of spillover effects. The Zhuhai\u2013Zhongshan\u2013Jiangmen metropolitan area has not yet formed a stable synergistic development relationship.

Aerobic exercise effectively increases the high-density lipoproteins-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and alleviates the triglyceride (TG) levels. The consumption of Cuban policosanol (Raydel\u00ae) is also effective in enhancing the HDL-C quantity and HDL functionality to treat dyslipidemia and hypertension. On the other hand, no study has examined the effects of a combination of high-intensity exercise and policosanol consumption in obese subjects to improve metabolic disorders. In the current study, 17 obese subjects (average BMI 30.1 \u00b1 1.1 kg\/m2, eight male and nine female) were recruited to participate in a program combining exercise and policosanol (20 mg) consumption for 12 weeks. After completion, their BMI, waist circumference, total fat mass, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduced significantly up to around \u221215%, \u221213%, \u221233%, \u221211%, and \u221213%, respectively. In the serum lipid profile, at Week 12, a significant reduction was observed in the total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, up to \u221217% and \u221254% from the baseline, respectively. The serum HDL-C was elevated by approximately +12% from the baseline, as well as the percentage of HDL-C in TC, and HDL-C\/TC (%), was enhanced by up to +32% at Week 12. The serum coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) level was increased 1.2-fold from the baseline in all participants at Week 12. In particular, the male participants exhibited a 1.4-fold increase from the baseline. The larger rise in serum CoQ10 was correlated with the larger increase in the serum HDL-C (r = 0.621, p = 0.018). The hepatic function parameters were improved; the serum \u03b3-glutamyl transferase decreased at Week 12 by up to \u221255% (p &lt; 0.007), while the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels diminished within the normal range. In the lipoprotein level, the extent of oxidation and glycation were reduced significantly with the reduction in TG content. The antioxidant abilities of HDL, such as paraoxonase (PON) and ferric ion reduction ability (FRA), were enhanced significantly by up to 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold at Week 12. The particle size and number of HDL were elevated up to +10% during the 12 weeks, with a remarkable decline in the TG content, glycation extent, and oxidation. The improvements in HDL quality and functionality were linked to the higher survivability of adult zebrafish and their embryos, under the co-presence of carboxymethyllysine (CML), a pro-inflammatory molecule known to cause acute death. In conclusion, 12 weeks of Cuban policosanol (Raydel\u00ae, 20 mg) consumption with high-intensity exercise displayed a significant improvement in blood pressure, body fat mass, blood lipid profile without liver damage, CoQ10 metabolism, and renal impairment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Pharmaceuticals"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/info15010060","title":["Mapping the Landscape of Misinformation Detection: A Bibliometric Approach"],"author":[{"given":"Andra","family":"Sandu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economic Informatics and Cybernetics, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, 010552 Bucharest, Romania"}]},{"given":"Ioana","family":"Ioan\u0103\u0219","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Business and Administration, University of Bucharest, 030018 Bucharest, Romania"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3589-1969","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Camelia","family":"Delcea","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economic Informatics and Cybernetics, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, 010552 Bucharest, Romania"}]},{"given":"Laura-M\u0103d\u0103lina","family":"Geant\u0103","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Accounting and Audit, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, 010552 Bucharest, Romania"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4192-183X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Liviu-Adrian","family":"Cotfas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economic Informatics and Cybernetics, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, 010552 Bucharest, Romania"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The proliferation of misinformation presents a significant challenge in today\u2019s information landscape, impacting various aspects of society. While misinformation is often confused with terms like disinformation and fake news, it is crucial to distinguish that misinformation involves, in mostcases, inaccurate information without the intent to cause harm. In some instances, individuals unwittingly share misinformation, driven by a desire to assist others without thorough research. However, there are also situations where misinformation involves negligence, or even intentional manipulation, with the aim of shaping the opinions and decisions of the target audience. Another key factor contributing to misinformation is its alignment with individual beliefs and emotions. This alignment magnifies the impact and influence of misinformation, as people tend to seek information that reinforces their existing beliefs. As a starting point, some 56 papers containing \u2018misinformation detection\u2019 in the title, abstract, or keywords, marked as \u201carticles\u201d, written in English, published between 2016 and 2022, were extracted from the Web of Science platform and further analyzed using Biblioshiny. This bibliometric study aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the field of misinformation detection by examining its evolution and identifying emerging trends, influential authors, collaborative networks, highly cited articles, key terms, institutional affiliations, themes, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the study reviews the most cited papers and provides an overview of all selected papers in the dataset, shedding light on methods employed to counter misinformation and the primary research areas where misinformation detection has been explored, including sources such as online social networks, communities, and news platforms. Recent events related to health issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened interest within the research community regarding misinformation detection, a statistic which is also supported by the fact that half of the papers included in top 10 papers based on number of citations have addressed this subject.

This review explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in neuropsychological assessment for the early detection and personalized treatment of MCI and AD. The review includes 37 articles that demonstrate that AI could be an useful instrument for optimizing diagnostic procedures, predicting cognitive decline, and outperforming traditional tests. Three main categories of applications are identified: (1) combining neuropsychological assessment with clinical data, (2) optimizing existing test batteries using ML techniques, and (3) employing virtual reality and games to overcome the limitations of traditional tests. Despite advancements, the review highlights a gap in developing tools that simplify the clinician\u2019s workflow and underscores the need for explainable AI in healthcare decision making. Future studies should bridge the gap between technical performance measures and practical clinical utility to yield accurate results and facilitate clinicians\u2019 roles.

This is extremely useful in biomanufacturing because using the UMM for the joint estimation of states and parameters with an extended Kalman filter (JEKF) can enable the real-time monitoring of bioprocesses with unknown mechanisms. However, the UMM commonly used in biomanufacturing contains ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with unshared parameters, weak variables, and weak terms. When such a UMM is coupled with an initial state error covariance matrix P(t=0) and a process error covariance matrix Q with uncorrelated elements, along with just one measured state variable, the joint extended Kalman filter (JEKF) fails to estimate the unshared parameters and state simultaneously. This is because the Kalman gain corresponding to the unshared parameter remains constant and equal to zero. In this work, we formally describe this failure case, present the proof of JEKF failure, and propose an approach called SANTO to side-step this failure case. The SANTO approach consists of adding a quantity to the state error covariance between the measured state variable and unshared parameter in the initial P(t = 0) of the matrix Ricatti differential equation to compute the predicted error covariance matrix of the state and prevent the Kalman gain from being zero. Our empirical evaluations using synthetic and real datasets reveal significant improvements: SANTO achieved a reduction in root-mean-square percentage error (RMSPE) of up to approximately 17% compared to the classical JEKF, indicating a substantial enhancement in estimation accuracy.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Sensors"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/mining4010004","title":["Removal of Fe3+ Ions from Aqueous Solutions by Adsorption on Natural Eco-Friendly Brazilian Palygorskites"],"author":[{"given":"Antonieta","family":"Middea","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Mineral Technology (CETEM), Av.

Both WCA and older adult mango consumers had greater than 20% higher intakes of fiber and vitamin C and WCA consumers had upwards of 10% higher folate, magnesium, and potassium intakes compared with non-consumers. Both groups of consumers had lower intake of saturated fat and older adults had lower intakes of protein and vitamin B12. Diet quality was 16 and 13% higher in WCA and older adult consumers compared with non-consumers, respectively. Additionally, mango consumers had lower beef, poultry, fish, and solid fat intakes and WCA consumers had higher whole grain intakes compared with non-consumers.

Methods: We aimed to investigate the effect of ICI on arterial 2-[18F]FDG uptake by using 2-[18F]FDG PET\/CT imaging pre\/post treatment in 47 patients with lung cancer. Maximum 2-[18F]FDG standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratios (TBRs) were calculated along six arterial segments. We classified the arterial PET lesions by pre-existing active inflammation (cut-off: TBRpre \u2265 1.6). 2-[18F]FDG metabolic activity pre\/post treatment was also quantified in bone marrow, spleen, and liver. Circulating blood biomarkers were additionally collected at baseline and after immunotherapy. Results: ICI treatment resulted in significantly increased arterial inflammatory activity, detected by increased TBRs, in all arterial PET lesions analyzed. In particular, a significant elevation of arterial 2-[18F]FDG uptake was only recorded in PET lesions without pre-existing inflammation, in calcified as well as in non-calcified lesions. Furthermore, a significant increase in arterial 2-[18F]FDG metabolic activity after immunotherapy was solely observed in patients not previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy as well as in those without CV risk factors. No significant changes were recorded in either 2-[18F]FDG uptake of bone marrow, spleen and liver after treatment, or the blood biomarkers.

In this work, we proposed an improved fabrication process for ultra-deep mesa-structured silicon APDs for photodetection in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths with improved performance and reduced costs. The improved process reduced the complexity through significantly reduced photolithography steps, e.g., half of the steps of the existing process. Additionally, single ion implantation was performed under low energy (lower than 30 keV) to further reduce the fabrication costs. Based on the improved ultra-concise process, a deep-mesa silicon APD with a 140 V breakdown voltage was obtained.

Cadmium(II) complexes of such ligands have provided models of solvent extraction of this toxic metal ion from aqueous environments using 2-pyridyl ketoxime extractants. Di-2-pyridyl ketone oxime (dpkoxH) is a unique member of this family of ligands because its substituent on the oxime carbon bears another potential donor site, i.e., a second 2-pyridyl group. The goal of this study was to investigate the reactions of cadmium(II) halides and dpkoxH in order to assess the structural role (if any) of the halogeno ligand and compare the products with their zinc(II) analogs. The synthetic studies provided access to complexes {[CdCl2(dpkoxH)\u22192H2O]}n (1\u22192H2O), {[CdBr2(dpkoxH)]}n (2) and {[CdI2(dpkoxH)]}n (3) in 50\u201360% yields. The structures of the complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The compounds consist of structurally similar 1D zigzag chains, but only 2 and 3 are strictly isomorphous. Neighboring CdII atoms are alternately doubly bridged by halogeno and dpkoxH ligands, the latter adopting the \u03b71:\u03b71:\u03b71:\u03bc (or 2.0111 using Harris notation) coordination mode. A terminal halogeno group completes distorted octahedral coordination at each metal ion, and the coordination sphere of the CdII atoms is {CdII(\u03b71 \u2212 X)(\u03bc \u2212 X)2(Npyridyl)2(Noxime)} (X = Cl, Br, I). The trans-donor\u2013atom pairs in 1\u22192H2O are Clterminal\/Noxime and two Clbridging\/Npyridyl; on the contrary, these donor\u2013atom pairs are Xterminal\/Npyridyl, Xbridging\/Noxime, and Xbridging\/Npyridyl (X = Br, I). There are intrachain H-bonding interactions in the structures. The packing of the chains in 1\u22192H2O is achieved via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, while the 3D architecture of the isomorphous 2 and 3 is built via C-H\u2219\u2219\u2219Cg (Cg is the centroid of one pyridyl ring) and \u03c0-\u03c0 overlaps. The molecular structures of 1\u22192H2O and 2 are different compared with their [ZnX2(dpkoxH)] (X = Cl, Br) analogs. The polymeric compounds were characterized by IR and Raman spectroscopies in the solid state, and the data were interpreted in terms of the known molecular structures. The solid-state structures of the complexes are not retained in DMSO, as proven via NMR (1H, 13C, and 113Cd NMR) spectroscopy and molar conductivity data. The complexes completely release the coordinated dpkoxH molecule, and the dominant species in solution seem to be [Cd(DMSO)6]2+ in the case of the chloro and bromo complexes and [CdI2(DMSO)4].<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Molecules"]},{"DOI":"10.3390\/s24020629","title":["Pressure Sensors: Working Principles of Static and Dynamic Calibration"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0183-132X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jos\u00e9 Dias","family":"Pereira","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"ESTSet\u00fabal, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Set\u00fabal, Rua do Vale de Chaves, Estefanilha, 2910-761 Set\u00fabal, Portugal"},{"name":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This paper starts with an overview of the main principles used for pressure measurements, focusing on their usage in industrial applications\u2019 domains.

Regarding calibration, it is important to note that there are several applications where the pressure signals to be measured can have large variations in short periods of time. In industrial applications, particularly in continuous production processes, generally, dynamic pressure measurements are less common; however, they are still required in several cases, such as control loops that are very sensitive to pressure variations, even if the frequencies of those variations are in the range of a few tens of hertz, or even lower. The last part of the paper presents the hardware and software of a flexible and low-cost static and dynamic pressure calibrator that also presents the capability to generate arbitrary waveform pressure signals for calibration and testing purposes. The proposed calibrator also includes the following advantages: remote pressure sensing capabilities that can be used to minimize calibration errors, such as those associated with capillary effects and pressure leakages; portability; and low cost.

Most of the current and future applications cannot exploit well-consolidated satellite positioning techniques such as Network Real Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP); the former is inapplicable for large user bases due to the necessity of a two-way communication link between the user and the NRTK service provider, while the latter necessitates long convergence times that are not in keeping with kinematic application.

Obtaining the band gap of a material via a labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient high-throughput calculation based on first principles is possible. However, it does not yield the most accurate results. Machine learning techniques emerge as a viable and effective substitute for conventional approaches in band gap prediction. This paper collected 201 pieces of data through the literature and open-source databases. By separating the features related to bits A, B, and X, a dataset of 1208 pieces of data containing 30 feature descriptors was established. The dataset underwent preprocessing, and the Pearson correlation coefficient method was employed to eliminate non-essential features as a subset of features. The band gap was predicted using the GBR algorithm, the random forest algorithm, the LightGBM algorithm, and the XGBoost algorithm, in that order, to construct a prediction model for organic\u2013inorganic hybrid perovskites. The outcomes demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm yielded an MAE value of 0.0901, an MSE value of 0.0173, and an R2 value of 0.991310.

We hypothesised that if idiom overextension holds, processing delays should be observed for idioms, as the (over)activated but contextually irrelevant figurative meanings would cause interference. In contrast, unambiguous control phrases should be faster to process. The results demonstrated undifferentiated processing for idioms used literally and control phrases across measures, with L2 proficiency affecting both similarly. Therefore, the findings do not support the hypothesis that advanced L2 users overextend idiom use in inappropriate contexts, nor that L2 proficiency modulates this tendency.

Non-clinical PKPD targets in combination with probability of target attainment (PTA) analyses generated breakpoints that were consistent with epidemiologic cutoffs and clinically derived breakpoints. In 6\/12 NDAs, there was limited data to support clinically derived breakpoints, and hence the non-clinical PKPD targets in combination with PTA analyses played a heightened role in the final breakpoint determination.

To assess the inhibitory effects of the compounds, various in vitro assays were employed. Three compounds, SR42, SR25, and SR10, displayed significant AChE inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 0.70 \u00b5M, 0.17 \u00b5M, and 1.00 \u00b5M, respectively. These values superseded the standard drug donepezil (1.96 \u00b5M). In the MAO-B inhibition assay, SR42 (IC50 = 43.21 \u00b5M) demonstrated superior inhibitory effects as compared to tryptamine and other derivatives. Moreover, SR22 (84.08%), SR24 (79.30%), and SR42 (75.16%) exhibited notable percent inhibition against the COX-2 enzyme at a tested concentration of 100 \u00b5M. To gain insights into their binding mode and to validate the biological results, molecular docking studies were conducted. Overall, the results suggest that SR42, a 4,5 nitro-benzoyl derivative of tryptamine, exhibited significant potential as a MTDL and warrants further investigation for the development of anti-Alzheimer agents.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Molecules"]},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s10461-024-04271-9","title":["Perception and Awareness about Monkeypox and Vaccination Acceptance in an At-Risk Population in Brescia, Italy: An Investigative Survey"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7965-6197","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Verena","family":"Crosato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Beatrice","family":"Formenti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maurizio","family":"Gulletta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Silvia","family":"Odolini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Silvia","family":"Compostella","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lina Rachele","family":"Tomasoni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alberto","family":"Matteelli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Francesco","family":"Castelli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Before 2022, monkeypox virus (Mpox) infection in humans was seldom reported outside Africa.

Security is, therefore, a crucial component of developing web applications. A web application's security is concerned with safeguarding the data it processes. The web application framework must have safeguards to stop and find application vulnerabilities. Among all web application attacks, SQL injection and XSS attacks are common, which may lead to severe damage to Web application data or web functionalities. Currently, there are many solutions provided by various study for SQLi and XSS attack detection, but most of the work shown have used either SQL\/XSS payload-based detection or HTTP request-based detection. Few solutions available can detect SQLi and XSS attacks, but these methods provide very high false positive rates, and the accuracy of these models can further be improved. We proposed a novel approach for securing web applications from both cross-site scripting attacks and SQL injection attacks using decoding and standardization of SQL and XSS payloads and HTTP requests and trained our model using hybrid deep learning networks in this paper. The proposed hybrid DL model combines the strengths of CNNs in extracting features from input data and LSTMs in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. The soundness of our approach lies in the use of deep learning techniques that can identify subtle patterns in the data that traditional machine learning-based methods might miss. We have created a testbed dataset of Normal and SQLi\/XSS HTTP requests and evaluated the performance of our model on this dataset. We have also trained and evaluated the proposed model on the Benchmark dataset HTTP CSIC 2010 and another SQL\/XSS payload dataset. The experimental findings show that our proposed approach effectively identifies these attacks with high accuracy and a low percentage of false positives. Additionally, our model performed better than traditional machine learning-based methods. This soundness approach can be applied to various network security applications such as intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls. Using our model, we achieved an accuracy of 99.84%, 99.23% and 99.77% on the SQL-XSS Payload dataset, Testbed dataset and HTTP CSIC 2010 dataset, respectively.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Scientific Reports"]},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s00204-023-03642-w","title":["Exposure limits for indoor volatile substances concerning the general population: The role of population-based differences in sensory irritation of the eyes and airways for assessment factors"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3705-6983","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stefan","family":"Kleinbeck","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1933-7351","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Peder","family":"Wolkoff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Assessment factors (AFs) are essential in the derivation of occupational exposure limits (OELs) and indoor air quality guidelines. The factors shall accommodate differences in sensitivity between subgroups, i.e., workers, healthy and sick people, and occupational exposure versus life-long exposure for the general population. Derivation of AFs itself is based on empirical knowledge from human and animal exposure studies with immanent uncertainty in the empirical evidence due to knowledge gaps and experimental reliability. Sensory irritation in the eyes and airways constitute about 30\u201340% of OELs and is an abundant symptom in non-industrial buildings characterizing the indoor air quality and general health. Intraspecies differences between subgroups of the general population should be quantified for the proposal of more \u2018empirical\u2019 based AFs. In this review, we focus on sensitivity differences in sensory irritation about gender, age, health status, and vulnerability in people, based solely on human exposure studies. Females are more sensitive to sensory irritation than males for few volatile substances. Older people appear less sensitive than younger ones. However, impaired defense mechanisms may increase vulnerability in the long term. Empirical evidence of sensory irritation in children is rare and limited to children down to the age of six years. Studies of the nervous system in children compared to adults suggest a higher sensitivity in children; however, some defense mechanisms are more efficient in children than in adults. Usually, exposure studies are performed with healthy subjects. Exposure studies with sick people are not representative due to the deselection of subjects with moderate or severe eye or airway diseases, which likely underestimates the sensitivity of the group of people with diseases. Psychological characterization like personality factors shows that concentrations of volatile substances far below their sensory irritation thresholds may influence the sensitivity, in part biased by odor perception. Thus, the protection of people with extreme personality traits is not feasible by an AF and other mitigation strategies are required. The available empirical evidence comprising age, lifestyle, and health supports an AF of not greater than up to 2 for sensory irritation. Further, general AFs are discouraged for derivation, rather substance-specific derivation of AFs is recommended based on the risk assessment of empirical data, deposition in the airways depending on the substance\u2019s water solubility and compensating for knowledge and experimental gaps. Modeling of sensory irritation would be a better \u2018empirical\u2019 starting point for derivation of AFs for children, older, and sick people, as human exposure studies are not possible (due to ethical reasons) or not generalizable (due to self-selection). Dedicated AFs may be derived for environments where dry air, high room temperature, and visually demanding tasks aggravate the eyes or airways than for places in which the workload is balanced, while indoor playgrounds might need other AFs due to physical workload and affected groups of the general population.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Archives of Toxicology"]},{"DOI":"10.1007\/s10670-023-00767-3","title":["Dated Truths Without Dated Powers"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9427-937X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Giacomo","family":"Giannini","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8018-2913","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Donatella","family":"Donati","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Dispositionalism is the theory of modality according to which all (metaphysical and natural) modal truths are made true by some actual irreducibly dispositional property.

The introduction of elastic deformation to Alloy 625 through constant extension rate tensile loading increased the anodic and corrosion currents. These increases were attributed to the increased stress caused by elastic deformation, which increased the number of defects in the oxide film on the surface of Alloy 625 and promoted stress corrosion; this was verified by the fact that the accept density (N<jats:sub>A<\/jats:sub>) was nearly ten times greater with elastic deformation than without elastic deformation. Intergranular corrosion (IGC) was induced without elastic deformation. IGC induction occurred because chloride ions were readily adsorbed at the grain boundaries and were more active than the grain bodies.

Its goal is to deliver a precise dose to the planning target volume (PTV) while protecting the surrounding organs at risk (OARs). However, the traditional workflow used by dosimetrists to plan the treatment is time-consuming and subjective, requiring iterative adjustments based on their experience. Deep learning methods can be used to predict dose distribution maps to address these limitations.  &amp;#xD;Approach: The study proposes a cascade model for organs at risk segmentation and dose distribution prediction. An encoder\u2013decoder network has been developed for the segmentation task, in which the encoder consists of transformer blocks, and the decoder uses multi\u2013scale convolutional blocks. Another cascade encoder\u2013decoder network has been proposed for dose distribution prediction using a pyramid architecture. The proposed model has been evaluated using an in\u2013house head and neck cancer dataset of 96 patients and OpenKBP, a public head and neck cancer dataset of 340 patients. &amp;#xD;Main results: The segmentation subnet achieved 0.79 and 2.71 for Dice and HD95 scores, respectively. This subnet outperformed the existing baselines. The dose distribution prediction subnet outperformed the winner of the OpenKBP2020 competition with 2.77 and 1.79 for dose and DVH scores, respectively.

The decomposition was performed using measured output factors and simulated depth dose curves and beam profiles in water as reference medium.

Excess amounts of heavy metals can accumulate in organisms of pollution impacted systems and transfer across a food web. Analysing the food web structure and metal contents of the organisms can help unravel the pathways of biomagnification or biodilution and gain insight in trophic linkages. We measured heavy metals and other elements in mussel bank detritus and organisms of the Biesbosch reservoirs (the Netherlands) and linked those to stable isotopic signatures. The heavy metal contents (cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) were often lowest in benthivorous, omnivorous and piscivorous species (mainly fish); whereas, phosphorus contents were lower in the autotrophs. Mussel bank detritus contained the highest amounts of heavy metals. The heavy metals were negatively correlated with \u03b4<jats:sup>15<\/jats:sup>N values. For selenium no clear trend was observed. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between fish length and some heavy metals. Based on all 20 analysed elemental contents, similarities between species became apparent, related to niche or habitat. This study confirms that elemental contents of species can differ between feeding guilds and\/or species, which can be attributed to metabolic and physiological processes. The organisms in higher trophic levels have adaptations preventing metal accumulation, resulting in lower contents. Within the fish species biodilution occurs, as most metal contents were lowest in bigger fish. Overall, the metals did not seem to biomagnify, but biodilute in the food web. Metal analyses combined with isotopic signatures could thus provide insights in metal transfer and possible trophic linkages within a system.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology"]},{"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-52083-7","title":["Multi-objective exponential distribution optimizer (MOEDO): a novel math-inspired multi-objective algorithm for global optimization and real-world engineering design problems"],"author":[{"given":"Kanak","family":"Kalita","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Janjhyam Venkata Naga","family":"Ramesh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lenka","family":"Cepova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sundaram B.","family":"Pandya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pradeep","family":"Jangir","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Laith","family":"Abualigah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The exponential distribution optimizer (EDO) represents a heuristic approach, capitalizing on exponential distribution theory to identify global solutions for complex optimization challenges.

This study investigates the sensitivity of a three-dimensional (3D) maritime ray tracing (RT) model for the use of the geometrical optics in radio channel characterizations of maritime environments. The channel measurement experiments are mainly carried out at three frequency points of 1.5, 1.8, and 2.5\u2009GHz, and the simulation results of the model are compared and corrected with the measured received power. Analysis shows that the modified model simulation results at 1.5, 1.8, and 2.5\u2009GHz frequency points are in good agreement with the actual measurement, and the RMS is within 7\u2009dB. Moreover, the reverse RT algorithm has the advantages of fast calculation speed and high efficiency.

Herein, we demonstrate a non\u2010etching activation strategy using cesium salts of low\u2010cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and specific surface areas reaching 3008 m2\u00b7g\u22121. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non\u2010classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic\/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores.

For practical application, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is however formidably challenging. Here, we propose a robust strategy for fabricating three\u2010dimensional (3D) amorphous noble metal\u2010based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increased from 18.2% to 59.4% after the creation of atomic channels. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by atomic\u2010resolution microstructural characterization, in situ and ex situ X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation induced photoemission spectroscopy, Ar<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>\u2010etching X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by creating atomic channels in amorphous Ir\u2010 and Pt\u2010based binary oxides. When amorphous Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>IrO<jats:sub>x<\/jats:sub> with atomic channels (Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>IrO<jats:sub>x<\/jats:sub>\u2010AE) was used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>IrO<jats:sub>x<\/jats:sub>\u2010AE are 1\u20132 orders of magnitude higher than those of crystalline CuO\/IrO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> and amorphous Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>IrO<jats:sub>x<\/jats:sub> without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts.

Among different types of sacrificial layers, the (Ca, Sr, Ba)<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>6<\/jats:sub> compounds are most widely used since they can be dissolved in water and prepare high\u2010quality perovskite oxide membranes with clean and sharp surfaces and interfaces; However, the typical transfer process takes a long time (up to hours) in obtaining millimeter\u2010size freestanding membranes, let alone realize wafer\u2010scale samples with high yield. Here, a new member of the SrO\u2010Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub> family, Sr<jats:sub>4<\/jats:sub>Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>7<\/jats:sub> is introduced, and its high dissolution rate, \u224810 times higher than that of Sr<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>6<\/jats:sub> is demonstrated.

AM is poised to revolutionize goods production by establishing a new manufacturing paradigm, from reducing lead times to enabling rapid prototyping. AM can facilitate the production of complicated geometries and create functioning components with distinctive features for aerospace and automotive applications. However, defects such as pores, voids, interfaces, and inclusions can impair the quality and functionality of AM components. Vibration Analysis (VA) has become a popular tool for the dynamic qualification and testing of products and non\u2010destructive testing, but the literature lacks a comprehensive review of VA applied to AM. Hence, this paper summarizes recent advances in the application of VA for identifying and characterizing flaws in metal alloys, including titanium, aluminum, and nickel\u2010based alloys produced by AM. The review also includes studies on defects, such as porosity, cracks, and inclusions, and their effect on VA. The article concludes with a discussion of the limitations of VA for defect characterization and future research directions. Overall, VA is a promising non\u2010destructive testing method for quality assurance in AM and offers insights on overcoming the difficulties for further development and application of this technology.<\/jats:p><jats:p>This article is protected by copyright.

These studies provide stoichiometric \u201cproof of concept\u201d for a proposed new metal\u2010catalyzed electrophilic hydrophosphination mechanism. The more strongly Lewis acidic phosphenium complex, [Mo(CO)4(PR2H)(PR2)]+ (R = Ph, Tolp), cleanly hydrophosphinates 1,1\u2010diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene, while other substrates react rapidly to give products resulting from competing electrophilic processes. A less Lewis acidic complex, [Mo(CO)3(PR2H)2(PR2)]+, generally reacts more slowly but participates in clean hydrophosphination of a wider range of unsaturated substrates, including styrene, indene, 1\u2010hexene, and cyclohexanone, in addition to 1,1\u2010diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene. Mechanistic studies are described, including stoichiometric control reactions and computational and kinetic analyses, which probe whether the observed P\u2010H addition actually does occur by the proposed electrophilic mechanism, and whether hydridic P\u2010H transfer in this system is intra\u2010 or intermolecular.
