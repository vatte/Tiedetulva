It analyses how the portrayal of torture as a \u2018barbaric\u2019 practice and the rationale for its prohibition in international law informed subsequent challenges. Focusing on France (Algeria), the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), Israel (Palestinians), and the United States of America (counter-terrorism) as key case studies, it shows how states employed legal stratagems to narrow the prohibition\u2019s application and necessity arguments, which were discursively underpinned by the ticking bomb scenario, to justify the use of torture while portraying themselves as \u2018civilized\u2019, \u2018rational\u2019, and \u2018humane\u2019. The discussion surrounding the case of G\u00e4fgen v Germany where the police threatened a suspected kidnapper with torture in their attempt to rescue a kidnapped child illustrates doctrinal challenges to the absolute prohibition in exceptional circumstances beyond the counter-terrorism context. The chapter concludes by highlighting the ambivalent consequences of the \u2018war on terror\u2019 for the prohibition, resulting in both problematic legal grey areas and multiple initiatives, including a focus on effective interviewing as a means to reduce recourse to coercive interrogation techniques.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Transformation of the Prohibition of Torture in International Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191994098.003.0004","title":["Diversity: Discriminatory Torture and Other Ill-treatment"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9209-6211","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lutz","family":"Oette","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The chapter examines the relationship between discrimination and torture and other ill-treatment. It focuses particularly on the interpretation of discriminatory torture, a notion that had long been neglected in international human rights law. A\u00a0review of developments in four key areas in the field of non-discrimination, namely gender, including gender identity and sexual orientation, \u2018race\u2019, disability, and age (children) provides evidence of an increasingly rich yet fragmented and partial jurisprudence and treaty body practice. It also shows the ambivalent role of international law in legitimizing problematic practices. Based on this review, the chapter sets out its interpretation of the elements of discriminatory torture, which focuses on all grounds of discrimination, including intersectional discrimination and neglected characteristics such as poverty, and identifies indicators that demonstrate discriminatory purpose. It makes a case for discriminatory torture and other ill-treatment to become an integral part of the contextual interpretation of the prohibition that is embedded in a broader transformative agenda which, by seeking to bring about equality, addresses the structural causes underpinning persistent torture practices.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Transformation of the Prohibition of Torture in International Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191955082.003.0014","title":["Morocco"],"author":[{"given":"Marius","family":"Schneider","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nora","family":"Ho Tu Nam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter looks at Morocco, which is located in the Maghreb region in North West Africa.

It examines the conceptual and doctrinal challenges posed by newly emerging methods of torture, namely less-lethal and autonomous weapons and digital torture as well as structural conditions, focusing on health, poverty, and environmental damage. Powerful and sophisticated weapons foster arsenals of repression, aggravate the impact of measures taken in the crowd-control context, and proliferate, in the absence of effective regulation, with the result of increasingly militarized law enforcement. Digital torture denotes a space for and mode of various forms of ill-treatment, which has distinctive features in terms of how its nature, impact, perpetrators, and setting inform the interpretation of the prohibition and states\u2019 obligations. Structural conditions have traditionally not been viewed through the lens of the prohibition. As the chapter demonstrates, however, the prohibition can play a vital role in linking widespread, systemic human suffering to state indifference and highlighting how states contribute to such suffering through systemic policy failures. The application of the prohibition in fields that typically fall within the purview of economic, social and cultural rights or other rights provides a critical complementary dimension, with its focus on what action states must take to protect human dignity in such contexts.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Transformation of the Prohibition of Torture in International Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191980060.003.0009","title":["Bugs in the Smart City"],"author":[{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Metzger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jean","family":"Hillier","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter brings a suburban fringe residential development in Australia into dialogue with \u2018smart\u2019 initiatives in mosquito management.

These mechanisms work by stabilising household incomes such that fluctuations in production do not filter through to consumption. Almost all existing monetary unions are true insurance unions, except for the euro area. This entails lower resilience to economic shocks and, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, implies that the ability to respond to different shocks may differ between countries and, therefore, hinder economic convergence and homogeneous operation of the euro area. In this regard, the creation of a European Unemployment Insurance (EUI) scheme is often cited as an important step towards macroeconomic smoothing within the euro area that could help mitigate the economic and social impact of large economic shocks. In this paper, I propose an EUI scheme, with partial coverage, calibrated to the characteristics of the Temporary Support to Mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE scheme) introduced during the COVID-19 crisis, and test its cyclical properties through simulation exercises, based on the payment and contribution flows in each country.

America has a virtually unique media system, in that there is almost no state funding of the mass media and relatively little regulation. As a result, media remain particularly wedded to traditional corporate structures that are vulnerable to economic pressures in the digital age. While the commercial basis of the U.S. media has traditionally been seen as healthy for American journalists by most analysts, newsmaking had been under significant financial pressure for decades. Some outlets, such as Fox News, have come to favor sensation and commentary over hard news to attract and engage audiences.

Subsequently, a broader grid with $ Y\/ Z$ from 1.0 to 3.0 was used in the fitting process. To account for observational uncertainties, two scenarios were explored: S1, with realistic uncertainties of 100 K in temperature and 0.1 dex in Fe\/H ; and S2, with halved uncertainties. We repeated the simulation at two baseline metallicities: Fe\/H = 0.0 and $-0.3$. The posterior distributions of $ Y\/ Z$ revealed significant biases. The distributions were severely biased towards the edge of the allowable range in the S1 error scenario. The situation only marginally improved when considering the S2 scenario. The effect is due to the impact of changing $ Y\/ Z$ in the stellar effective temperature and its interplay with Fe\/H observational error, and it is therefore not restricted to the specific fitting method. \nDespite the presence of these systematic discrepancies, the age of the systems were recovered unbiased with 10&lt;!PCT!&gt; precision.

We approach the AET reconstruction in two steps: First, the interior power density is obtained from boundary measurements by solving a linear inverse and ill-posed problem; second, the interior conductivity is reconstructed from the power density by solving a non-linear and well-posed problem. Mathematically these inverse problems are fairly well understood, and reconstruction methods work well on synthetic data. This is in contrast to experimental findings. An effect can indeed be observed and data can be collected. However, the acousto-electric coupling is very weak, and consequently, the change in the measured voltage due to the acoustic perturbation might be too small compared to the background noise for viable reconstructions. In this paper, we take one step towards understanding the feasibility of AET. We provide an in-silico model of the coupled physics scenario based on standard models for the individual phenomena. Moreover, we formulate and implement numerically a full reconstruction method for the inverse problem via the two steps. We perform computational experiments with realistically chosen parameters from the context of medical imaging. The focus is on understanding the role of the acousto-electric coupling parameter and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The critical signal strength is analyzed and the omnipresent Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise is estimated. We obtain both positive and negative findings; we can reconstruct features even under severe noise conditions, but we also find that the SNR one is likely to face in practice is too low to obtain useful reconstructions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Inverse Problems"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1161\/circulationaha.124.069494","title":["Randomized Evaluation of a

The outcomes of interest were MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction , or stroke), individual components of MACE (inclusive of fatal and nonfatal events), all-cause mortality, and death subtypes. Effect estimates for SGLT2i versus placebo were meta-analyzed across trials and examined across key subgroups (established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, previous HF, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease stages, and risk groups).<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>RESULTS:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>\n              A total of 78\u2009607 patients across 11 trials were included: 42\u2009568 (54.2%), 20\u2009725 (26.4%), and 15\u2009314 (19.5%) were included from trials of patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF, or chronic kidney disease, respectively.

The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements, as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe.

Based on this dataset, the paper proposes an optimized model, Att-Mask R-CNN, for canopy detection and segmentation. Att-Mask R-CNN outperforms the original models (Mask R-CNN and MS R-CNN) by achieving 65.29% mean average precision for detection, 80.44% mean intersection over union for segmentation, and 90.67% overall recognition rate for the six tree species. In addition, a pixel statistics method based on segmentation masks is introduced for estimating the vertical projected area of individual tree crowns, and comparisons between the measured and predicted vertical projected area of the crowns of six tree species (100 trees of each class) show an overall goodness-of-fit R2 of 85% and a relative root-mean-square error rRMSE of 12.81%. By using remote sensing images from RPAs and optimizing existing deep learning models, the detection and segmentation of individual tree canopies can be achieved, resulting in a more accurate understanding of forest structure, which provides scientific support for forest management and resource monitoring. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Canadian Journal of Forest Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.2460\/ajvr.24.03.0054","title":["Computed tomography findings of nasal cryptococcosis in Australia (2008\u20132020): 12 dogs and 9 cats"],"author":[{"given":"Samantha A.","family":"Wong","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Internal Medicine, Veterinary Specialist Services, Underwood, QLD, Australia"}]},{"given":"Else","family":"Jacobson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Internal Medicine, Veterinary Specialist Services, Underwood, QLD, Australia"}]},{"given":"Juan","family":"Podadera","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiology, University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Sydney, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia"}]},{"given":"Jia Wen","family":"Siow","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiology, Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Kent Town, SA, Australia"}]},{"given":"Dennis J.","family":"Woerde","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"William R Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA"}]},{"given":"Anna","family":"Tebb","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Internal Medicine, Western Australian Veterinary Emergency & Specialty, Success, WA, Australia"}]},{"given":"Mary","family":"Thompson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Internal Medicine, University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Sydney, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia"}]},{"given":"Dave","family":"Colins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Internal Medicine, Northside Veterinary Specialists, Terrey Hills, NSW, Australia"}]},{"given":"Julian","family":"Lunn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Surgery, University of Queensland Vets \u2013 Small Animal Hospital, Gatton, QLD, Australia"}]},{"given":"Richard","family":"Malik","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Veterinary Education, Sydney School of Veterinary Science, Veterinary Science Conference Center, NSW, Australia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n<jats:sec id=\"sc_a1\">\n<jats:title>OBJECTIVE<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>To describe the CT findings of Australian dogs and cats with nasal cryptococcosis over a 12-year period.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sc_a2\">\n<jats:title>ANIMALS<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>12 dogs and 9 cats diagnosed with nasal cryptococcosis from 2008 through 2020.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec id=\"sc_a3\">\n<jats:title>METHODS<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>CT findings were compared among enrolled cases from Australian veterinary referral centers.

However, a direct characterization of convective surface structures in terms of size, contrast, and lifespan is quite challenging, as spatially resolving these features requires the highest angular resolution. We aim to characterize the size of convective structures on the surface of the O-rich AGB star R Car to test different theoretical predictions based on mixing-length theory from solar models. We used infrared low-spectral resolution (Rsim 35) interferometric data in the $H$-band ( sim  1.76 mu m) obtained by the instrument PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) to image the star's surface at two epochs separated by approximately six years. Using a power spectrum analysis, we estimated the horizontal size of the structures on the surface of R Car. The sizes of the stellar disk at different phases of a pulsation cycle were obtained using parametric model fitting in the Fourier domain. Our analysis supports that the sizes of the structures in R Car are correlated with variations in the pressure scale height in the atmosphere of the target, as predicted by theoretical models based on solar convective processes. We observed that these structures grow in size when the star expands within a pulsation cycle. While the information is still scarce, this observational finding highlights the role of convection in the dynamics of those objects. New interferometric imaging campaigns with the renewed capabilities of the VLTI are envisioned to expand our analysis to a larger sample of objects.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.31223\/x5kx00","title":["Geophysical and Geochemical Constraints on Magma Storage Depths along the Cascade Arc: Knowns and Unknowns"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1070-8323","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Penny","family":"Wieser","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Adam","family":"Kent","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8924-2206","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christy","family":"Till","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Geoff","family":"Abers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The iconic volcanoes of the Cascade arc stretch from Lassen Volcanic Center in northern California, through Oregon and Washington, to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in British Columbia.

The availability of magma storage depth estimates varies greatly along the arc, with abundant geochemical and geophysical data available for some systems (e.g. Lassen Volcanic Center, Mt.

Acknowledging the limitations of data availability and the large uncertainties associated with certain methods, available data is indicative of magma storage within the upper 15 km of the crust (~2 &amp;plusmn; 2 kbar). These findings are consistent with previous work recognising barometric estimates cluster within the upper crust in many arcs worldwide.

However, the large number of different equations parametrizing the relationship between mineral and melt compositions and intensive variables such as pressure and temperature yield vastly different results, with implications for our interpretation of magma storage conditions. We use a new test dataset comprised of the average Cpx-Liq composition from N=543 variably-hydrous experiments at crustal conditions (1 bar to 17 kbar) to assess the performance of different thermobarometers, and identify the most accurate and precise expressions for application to subduction zone magmas. First, we assess different equilibrium tests, finding that comparing the measured and predicted EnFs and KD (using Fet in both phases) are the most useful tests in arc magmas, while CaTs, CaTi and Jd tests have limited utility. We then apply further quality filters based on cation sums (3.95-4.05), number of analyses (N&amp;gt;5), and the presence of reported H2O data in the quenched experimental glass (hereafter &amp;lsquo;liquid&amp;rsquo;) to obtain a filtered dataset (N=214). We use this filtered dataset to compare calculated versus experimental pressures and temperatures for different combinations of thermobarometers. A number of Cpx-Liq thermometers perform very well when liquid H2O contents are known, although the Cpx composition contributes relatively little to the calculated temperature. Most Cpx-only thermometers perform very badly, greatly overestimating temperatures for hydrous experiments. These two observations indicate that the Cpx chemistry alone holds very little temperature information in hydrous systems. Cpx-Liq and Cpx-only barometers show similar performance to one another, with most expressions yielding RMSEs of 2-3.5 kbar. We also assess the sensitivity of different equations to melt H2O contents, which are poorly constrained in many natural systems. Overall, this work demonstrates Cpx-based barometry on individual Cpx only provides sufficient resolution to distinguish broad storage regions (e.g., upper, mid, lower crust). However, after significant amounts of averaging of Cpx compositions from experiments reported at similar pressures, RMSEs can reduce to ~1.3-1.9 kbar for the best-behaving expressions.

We applied a state-of-the-art transformer algorithm to the 221 deg$^2$ of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) to search for new strong gravitational lenses (SGLs). We tested four transformer encoders trained on simulated data from the Strong Lens Finding Challenge on KiDS data. The best performing model was fine-tuned on real images of SGL candidates identified in previous searches. To expand the dataset for fine-tuning, data augmentation techniques were employed, including rotation, flipping, transposition, and white noise injection. The network fine-tuned with rotated, flipped, and transposed images exhibited the best performance and was used to hunt for SGLs in the overlapping region of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and KiDS surveys on galaxies up to $z$=0.8.\n   Candidate SGLs were matched with those from other surveys and examined using GAMA data to identify blended spectra resulting from the signal from multiple objects in a GAMA fiber. Fine-tuning the transformer encoder to the KiDS data reduced the number of false positives by 70&lt;!PCT!&gt;.\n   Additionally, applying the fine-tuned model to a sample of sim   5\\,000\\,000 galaxies resulted in a list of sim 51\\,000 SGL candidates.

Combined with the SGL candidates identified in the model testing, our final sample comprises 264 candidates, including 71 high-confidence SGLs; of these 71, 44 are new discoveries. We propose fine-tuning via real augmented images as a viable approach to mitigating false positives when transitioning from simulated lenses to real surveys. While our model shows improvement, it still does not achieve the same accuracy as previously proposed models trained directly on galaxy images from KiDS with added simulated lensing arcs. This suggests that a larger fine-tuning set is necessary for a competitive performance.\n   Additionally, we provide a list of 121 false positives that exhibit features similar to lensed objects, which can be used in the training of future machine learning models in this field.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/corrrev-2024-0013","title":["Modeling hydrogen diffusion in precipitation hardened nickel-based alloy 718 by microstructural modeling"],"author":[{"given":"Attilio","family":"Arcari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Corrosion Science and Engineering, Chemistry Division , 429540 U.S. Naval Research Laboratory , 4555 Overlook Avenue SW , Washington , DC 20375 , USA"}]},{"given":"Mohammed A.","family":"Zikry","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , NC , 27695 , USA"}]},{"given":"Patrick G.","family":"Callahan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Materials Science and Technology Division , 429540 U.S. Naval Research Laboratory , 4555 Overlook Avenue SW , Washington , DC 20375 , USA"}]},{"given":"Derek J.","family":"Horton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Corrosion Science and Engineering, Chemistry Division , 429540 U.S. Naval Research Laboratory , 4555 Overlook Avenue SW , Washington , DC 20375 , USA"}]},{"given":"Muh-Jang","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , NC , 27695 , USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Environmentally assisted cracking can significantly affect the performance of high strength alloys and limit material selection to minimize the risk of subcritical crack growth in service.

The microstructural model was subjected to the boundary conditions identified at the notch root of a fracture mechanics sample and the results are used as input for a simulation of hydrogen diffusion from the surface of the notch, assuming the material has been introduced to a hydrogen producing environment. The diffusion of hydrogen was modeled by Fick\u2019s law and included both hydrostatic stress and mobile dislocation velocity as driving forces. The influence of immobile dislocations was also modeled to account for the irreversible trapping.

part of the Early Release Observations (ERO) programme, we analysed deep, wide-field imaging from the VIS and NISP instruments of two Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), namely NGC 6254 (M10) and NGC 6397, to look for observational evidence of their dynamical interaction with the Milky Way. We searched for such an interaction in the form of structural and morphological features in the clusters' outermost regions, which would be suggestive of the development of tidal tails on scales larger than those sampled by the ERO data. From our multi-band photometric analysis, we obtained deep and well-behaved colour--magnitude diagrams that, in turn, enabled an accurate membership selection. The surface brightness profiles built from these samples of member stars are the deepest ever obtained for these two Milky Way GCs, reaching down to $ mag\/arcsec$^2$, which is $ mag\/arcsec$^2$ lower than before. The investigation of the two-dimensional density map of NGC 6254 reveals an elongated morphology of the cluster peripheries in the direction and with the amplitude predicted by $N$-body simulations of the cluster's dynamical evolution, at high statistical significance. We interpret this as strong evidence for the first detection of tidally induced morphological distortion around this cluster. The density map of NGC 6397 reveals a slightly elliptical morphology, in agreement with previous studies, which requires further investigation on larger scales to be properly interpreted. This ERO project thus demonstrates the power of in studying the outer regions of GCs at an unprecedented level of detail, thanks to the combination of the large field of view, high spatial resolution, and depth enabled by the telescope.

The conversion of these measurements to the spatial frame of the plasma is a great challenge, but it is required for direct comparison of the measurements with magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theories. We present a tool kit based on the synthetic modeling of solar wind fluctuations as two-dimensional noise maps with adjustable spectral and power anisotropy that can help with the temporal-spatial conversion of real data. Specifically, by following the spacecraft trajectory through a noise map (relative velocity and angle relative to some mean magnetic field) with properties tuned to mimic those of the solar wind, the likelihood that the temporal data fluctuations represent parallel or perpendicular fluctuations in the plasma frame can be quantified by correlating structure functions of the noise map. Synthetic temporal data can also be generated, which can provide a testing ground for analysis applied to the solar wind data. We demonstrate this tool by investigating Parker Solar Probe's seventh encounter trajectory and data, and we showcase several possible ways in which it can be used. We find that whether temporal variations in the spacecraft frame come from parallel or perpendicular variations in the plasma frame strongly depends on the spectral and power anisotropy of the measured wind. Data analysis assisted by such underlying synthetic models as presented here could open up new ways to interpret measurements in the future, specifically in the more reliable determination of plasma frame quantities from temporal measurements.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1108\/jpbm-09-2023-4706","title":["The role of augmented reality app attributes and customer-based brand equity on consumer behavioral responses: an S-O-R framework perspective"],"author":[{"given":"Ziyou","family":"Jiang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jewon","family":"Lyu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Augmented reality (AR) provides consumers with added value by allowing them to experience products via mobile devices.

Past articles revealed changes in parental attitudes towards their children's romantic relationships during university years, highlighting a shift from traditional opposition to increased support, potentially impacting financial assistance. Another stream of research focused on the ongoing marriage crisis in China, where declining marriage rates and rising divorce rates are influenced by socioeconomic changes, urbanization, and evolving marital values. They suggest that economic and cultural shifts play significant roles. This paper integrates sociocultural dynamics with a model of deferred acceptance in matchmaking to explore how shifts toward more progressive parental attitudes could be exacerbating the marriage crisis in China.

The plurality inherent in this development, rather than constituting a case of problematic fragmentation, bears considerable potential for both tailored and integrated approaches.

It draws out the implications of a relational, structural conception of torture and other ill-treatment that is informed by the experiences of torture survivors for the interpretation of the prohibition and approaches to prevention, accountability, and reparation. It argues that the transformation of the prohibition must be understood as an ongoing process rather than as a specific outcome. The nature and extent of this transformation is tied to how the multiple actors in the field handle the dialectic tension between traditional\/narrow and progressive\/broad conceptions inherent in the prohibition. This includes moving beyond the established paradigm to address myriad forms of suffering, which entails probing the potential of the prohibition to fulfil its role as an archetype in international law. Such archetype is not confined to a focus on brutality but should be considered as embodying having regard to human dignity in all situations of unjustifiable pain, suffering, or degradation. Developing a conceptual and contextual understanding of torture and other ill-treatment helps provide a framework for a tailored approach that navigates between the universal and the local to determine what is perceived as amounting to unjustified harm in the circumstances. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of the implementation of legal standards to ensure that the prohibition is effective. However, it equally acknowledges that the prohibition operates within a legal framework that has several problematic features. The book concludes by highlighting the fundamental, distinctive role played by the prohibition in the wider, ongoing struggle against torture and other ill-treatment worldwide.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Transformation of the Prohibition of Torture in International Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191955082.003.0012","title":["Kenya"],"author":[{"given":"Marius","family":"Schneider","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nora","family":"Ho Tu Nam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter focuses on Kenya, which is found in East Africa.

It probes how conceptual, doctrinal, and empirical scholarship can inform and enrich the interpretation of torture, with a particular focus on the psychological dimension of torture, its application to non-state actors, and the notion of powerlessness. Building on these sources, the chapter sets out a relational understanding of torture based on power asymmetries, levels of degradation, and exclusion from humanity which forms part of wider structures marked by inequality, marginalization, and exclusion. It discusses the merits and challenges associated with developments towards a holistic conception of torture that moves beyond its conventional state-centric, method-specific, and detention-oriented focus. Equally, it explores the scope for transcending case-specific approaches to the value-laden notions of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by applying a conceptually grounded, contextual, and culturally-informed notion of the various forms of ill-treatment. The interpretation of the prohibition has significantly curtailed forms of punishment, including corporal punishment, the death penalty, and modalities of imprisonment. However, the chapter argues that jurisprudence and treaty body practice have privileged Western conceptions of imprisonment as normalized, \u2018humane\u2019 punishment, notwithstanding significant evidence that testifies to its detrimental, harmful, and frequently dehumanizing nature and impact.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Transformation of the Prohibition of Torture in International Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191955082.003.0013","title":["Mauritius"],"author":[{"given":"Marius","family":"Schneider","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nora","family":"Ho Tu Nam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter discusses the island nation of Mauritius, found in the Indian Ocean.

In an era of climate change, ecological instability, and fragmented human relationships, we reflect here on the kinds of connections that we might model through our encounters with animal \u2018others\u2019 in the smart city and consider how to shift relationships of knowledge and practice towards liberation.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Designing More-than-Human Smart Cities"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780191980060.003.0005","title":["Reciprocities of Decay, Destruction, and Designing"],"author":[{"given":"Yoko","family":"Akama","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Towns and cities have always been in continual cycles of destruction and regeneration.

The study reveals the principles of the Tianche craft, including mature craft procedure and reliable binding joints.

Additionally, the study identifies two limitations of the craft: restricted column diameters and the tendency of the inverted dragon member\u2019s tenon to break. This study investigated Tianche timber structures featuring hollow, bundle-like columns with frictional force transmission mechanism, presenting new possibilities beyond mainstream timber structural systems. The findings may contribute to enhancing research on the Tianche craft and could lay the foundation for future conservation practices related to Tianche heritage.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Heritage Science"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/ract-2023-0243","title":["Evaluating SiO<sub>2<\/sub>\/Al<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>3<\/sub>\/poly(acrylic acid-co-glycidyl methacrylate) composite as a novel adsorbent for cobalt(II) radionuclides"],"author":[{"given":"Amr M.","family":"Emara","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Nuclear Chemistry Department , Hot Laboratories Center, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority , Cairo , 13759 , Egypt"}]},{"given":"Emad M.","family":"Elsharma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nuclear Chemistry Department , Hot Laboratories Center, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority , Cairo , 13759 , Egypt"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0760-4451","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Islam M.","family":"Abdelmonem","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nuclear Chemistry Department , Hot Laboratories Center, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority , Cairo , 13759 , Egypt"}]},{"given":"Mamdoh R.","family":"Mahmoud","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Nuclear Chemistry Department , Hot Laboratories Center, Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority , Cairo , 13759 , Egypt"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A novel SiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\/Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>\/poly(acrylic acid-co-glycidyl methacrylate), SiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>\/Al<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>\/P(AA-co-GMA), composite was synthesized and evaluated for its effectiveness in adsorbing Co(II) ions from aqueous solutions.

Toward this end, the use of clean fuels is strongly recommended by environmentalists. Benchmarking techniques, especially data envelopment analysis, are an appropriate tool for measuring the relative efficiency of firms with environmental pollutants. In classic data envelopment analysis models, decision-makers are faced with production processes in which reducible inputs are used to produce expandable outputs. In this contribution, we consider production processes when the input and output data are given in stochastic form and some throughputs are reducible and some others are expandable. A stochastic directional distance function model is proposed to calculate the relative technical efficiency of firms. In order to evaluate firm-specific technical efficiency, we apply bootstrap DEA. We first calculate the technical efficiency scores of firms by classic DEA model. Then, the double bootstrap DEA model is applied to determine the impact of explanatory variables on firm efficiency. To demonstrate the applicability of the procedure, we present an empirical application wherein we employ power plants.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["RAIRO - Operations Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1108\/ilt-03-2024-0067","title":["Experimental study on operating characteristics of rotor-bearing system lubricated by gallium-based liquid metal"],"author":[{"given":"Chunjie","family":"Wei","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qi","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jimin","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiaojun","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wei","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the operating characteristics of gallium-based liquid metals (GLMs) by directly adding them as lubricants in real mechanical equipment.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper conducts an analysis of the rotor-bearing system under GLM lubrication using a constructed test rig, focusing on vibration signals, surface characteristics of the friction pair, contact resistance and temperature rise features.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study reveals that GLM can effectively improve the lubrication condition of the tribo-pair, leading to a more stable vibration signal in the system.

Traditionally, these reservoirs have been linked to diffuse Lyman-alpha ( emission extending beyond approx parsec scales. In recent years, millimeter and submillimeter observations  have started to identify even colder gas in the CGM through molecular and\/or atomic tracers such as the transition. In this context, we studied the well-known system at $z=4.54$ that hosts a massive dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG), a UV-bright companion, and a blob. We combined new ALMA line observations taken by the CRISTAL survey with data from previous programs targeting the system, and achieved a deep view into a DSFG and its rich environment at a $ parsec $ resolution. \n   We identified an elongated structure with a projected size of parsec stemming from the bright DSFG at the center of the field, with no clear counterpart at any other wavelength. The plume is oriented approx away from the minor axis of the DSFG, and shows significant spatial variation of its spectral parameters. In particular, the emission shifts from second to second between the bottom and top of the plume, relative to the DSFG's systemic velocity. At the same time, the line width starts at $400- second $ but narrows down to second at the top end of the plume.  We discuss four possible scenarios to interpret the plume: a conical outflow, a cold accretion stream, ram pressure stripping, and gravitational interactions. While we cannot strongly rule out any of these with the available data, we disfavor the ram pressure stripping scenario due to the requirement of special hydrodynamic conditions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/tjb-2023-0283","title":["Evaluation of adropin indices and PCSK9 in non-diabetic men with severe obstructive sleep apnea"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5444-9116","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Levent","family":"Deniz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medical Biochemistry , University of Health Sciences Turkey, Bagc\u0131lar Training and Research Hospital , Istanbul , T\u00fcrkiye"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1996-956X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hale","family":"Aral","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medical Biochemistry , University of Health Sciences Turkey, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital , Istanbul , T\u00fcrkiye"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8656-4581","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"\u00d6zlem","family":"Akdo\u011fan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology , University of Health Sciences Turkey, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital , Istanbul , T\u00fcrkiye"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8986-3774","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hilmi Furkan","family":"Arslan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medical Biochemistry , Giresun University Maternity and Children Training and Research Hospital , Giresun , T\u00fcrkiye"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9853-6238","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Enes","family":"Yi\u011fit","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology , University of Health Sciences Turkey, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital , Istanbul , T\u00fcrkiye"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:sec id=\"j_tjb-2023-0283_abs_001\">\n                  <jats:title>Objectives<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We aimed to investigate the relationship among proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), adropin levels, inflammation, and sleep variables in non-diabetic males with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec id=\"j_tjb-2023-0283_abs_002\">\n                  <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This cross-sectional study included adults aged 18\u00a0to 65 who underwent polysomnography due to sleep problems between July 2019 and August 2020.

This study delves into features of 617 traditional and 289 modern pieces through text mining techniques, including text segmentation, the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) method, and the complex network analysis. We examine the frequency and emotional purity of lyrics at a larger scale than previous studies using a small set of manually annotated samples. Furthermore, we analyze the patterns of MNRs by assessing the overall, individual, core-periphery structures of the constructed MNR networks, considering key terms as nodes and co-occurrence relationships between nodes as links. Our investigation reveals the heterogeneous nature of terms in both traditional and modern MNR networks. Moreover, through the community detection method, we identify five primary imagery features presented in MNRs.

Therefore, examining the impact of modern media on women entrepreneurs in contemporary society is a complex and significant issue. Focusing on the growing importance of this topic, the paper aims to explore the impact of media coverage on the image and status of women entrepreneurs. The impact is identified through questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and media content analysis. It conducts an online questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews with 300 women entrepreneurs and 20 women entrepreneurs from different industries. The results showes that over 65% of the respondents believed that media bias had a negative impact on their entrepreneurial spirit, and almost 70% felt that their businesses did not receive fair coverage.

In this study, we link a model of planet formation by pebble accretion to the planets' long-term observational properties by calculating the interior evolution, starting from the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. We investigate the evolution of the interior structure in 5--20 planets accounting for silicate redistribution caused by convective mixing, rainout (condensation and settling), and mass loss. \nSpecifically, we have followed the fate of the hot silicate vapor that remained in the planet's envelope after planet formation as the planet cools.\nWe find that disk dissipation is followed by a rapid contraction of the envelope from the \nHill or Bondi radius to about one-tenth of that size within 10 Myr. \nSubsequent cooling leads to substantial growth of the planetary core through silicate rainout accompanied by inflated radii, in comparison to the standard models of planets that formed with core-envelope structure. \nWe examined the dependence of rainout on the planet's envelope mass, on the distance from its host star, on its silicate mass, and on the atmospheric opacity.\nWe find that the population of planets that formed with polluted envelopes can be roughly divided into three groups based on the mass of their gas envelopes: bare rocky cores that have shed their envelopes, super-Earth planets with a core-envelope structure, and Neptune-like planets with diluted cores that undergo gradual rainout. For polluted planets that formed with envelope masses below 0.4 we anticipate that the inflation of the planet's radius caused by rainout will enhance the mass loss by a factor of 2--8 compared to planets with unpolluted envelopes.

The effectiveness of such self-confinement relies on a balance between the CRSI growth rate and the damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include the most recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regimes. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important is also discussed. The  Els\\\"asser formalism is employed. Particular attention is given to the role of a nonlinearity parameter $ that estimates the strength of the nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AW packets and the background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $ and the parameter $ that instead describes the intrinsic strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. Turbulent damping rates of quasi-parallel AW packets and cosmic-ray feedback (CRF) are derived within this formalism. When the strength of the nonlinear interaction is properly taken into account, we find that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in sub-Alfv\\'enic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuation amplitude to the third power, and hence is strongly suppressed; (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained; and (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CRF is derived and a simple phenomenological model of CR-modified scaling of background fluctuations is provided.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/mr-2024-0024","title":["Eco-fertility: examining the climate change-total fertility rate nexus in the context of sustainable developmental goals in a systematic review approach"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1928-5048","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pallav","family":"Sengupta","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine , Gulf Medical University , Ajman , United Arab Emirates"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7893-5282","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sulagna","family":"Dutta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Basic Medical Sciences Department, College of Medicine , Ajman University , Ajman , United Arab Emirates"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are paramount as the global community confronts the ramifications of climate alterations, especially its implications on population dynamics.

The spectra have an effective spectral resolution between 900 and 3500, depending on the wavelength and grating order.

Forced dedifferentiation paired with oncogene expression is sufficient to drive cardiac regeneration, but elucidation of endogenous developmental regulators of the switch between regenerative and mature cardiomyocyte cell states is necessary for optimal design of regenerative approaches for heart disease. MBNL1 (muscleblind-like 1) regulates fibroblast, thymocyte, and erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Hence, we examined whether MBNL1 promotes and maintains mature cardiomyocyte states while antagonizing cardiomyocyte proliferation.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>METHODS:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>MBNL1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models were studied at several developmental time points and in surgical models of heart regeneration.

Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, whereas loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of estrogen-related receptor signaling was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity in adult myocytes. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of neonatal cardiac regeneration, where increased MBNL1 expression arrested myocyte proliferation and regeneration and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. However, MBNL1 deficiency was insufficient to promote regeneration in the adult heart because of cell cycle checkpoint activation.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Here, MBNL1 was identified as an essential regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states, their developmental switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, and their regenerative potential through controlling an entire maturation program by stabilizing adult myocyte mRNAs during postnatal development and throughout adulthood.

This provides an invalid mathematical foundation for many reasons, especially because WAR should not be linear with respect to any counting statistic. To repair this defect, as well as many others, we devise a new measure, Grid WAR, which accurately estimates a starting pitcher\u2019s WAR on a per-game basis. The convexity of Grid WAR diminishes the impact of \u201cblow-up\u201d games and up-weights exceptional games, raising the valuation of pitchers like Sandy Koufax, Whitey Ford, and Catfish Hunter who exhibit fundamental game-by-game variance.

This work carried out a comprehensive review of the available Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in Nigeria, assess its level of utilization, identified the challenges and suggested effective ways of ensuring adoption of decentralized energy system through the use of RES. Critical analysis of public opinions on the acceptability of RES as a decentralized energy system in the country were carried out. The work sampled the opinions of people in the adoption of RES for decentralized energy system using south west, Nigeria as a case study.

Nowadays, bilingual education for preschool children has become one of the most important research topics. The feasibility and superiority of bilingual education for preschool children have been confirmed by existing studies. However, the bilingual education for preschool children in China is relatively inadequate. Therefore, on account of three aspects: parents, kindergarten, and government, this paper analyses the current status and problems of bilingual education for preschool children in China and puts forward possibly effective recommendations separately based on Chinese actual conditions. This paper points out that there are some problems in the bilingual education for preschool children in China, such as the inadequate knowledge and vague expectations leading to blind selections in parents, insufficient qualified teachers and unscientific teaching activities in kindergartens, and negligent supervision and minor policies in government. This paper suggests that parents should increase their knowledge and conduct scientific family education, kindergartens should improve their teachers and organize scientific teaching activities, and government should strengthen the supervision and support the introduction of policies and academic research. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Lecture Notes in Education Psychology and Public Media"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,4]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/humaff-2023-0120","title":["Critical Thinking as an Integrative Process: Debating Wolves in Yellowstone"],"author":[{"given":"Lynn Sargent","family":"De Jonghe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The Cobb Institute , Claremont , CA 91711 , USA"},{"name":"1545 Webster Avenue , Claremont , CA 91711 , USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The topic of critical thinking has engaged philosophers, psychologists and educators for well over one hundred years.

This article reviews the ebb and flow of critical thinking efforts, suggests explanations for their discouraging results, and proposes a way forward that treats critical thinking as an integrative process advanced by Mary Parker Follet, and more recently espoused by Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway. In the exploratory spirit of John Dewey and Alfred North Whitehead, I am introducing this essay, not with analysis or theory, but with a narrative of educational events in all their richness of context.

Young people in Latin America, Europe, and Asia began organizing new groups, and they interjected new life into the movement. Writers like Jacques Vallee and John Keel offered up fresh ideas, introducing the notion that UFOs might be less about outer space than about something supernatural here on earth.

The rapid F. pseudograminearum epidemic and FCR outbreak within a decade remain unexplained. In this study, two high-quality, chromosome-level genomes of F. pseudograminearum strains producing 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3AcDON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15AcDON) toxins were assembled. Additionally, 38 related strains were resequenced. Genomic differences such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions\/deletions (indels), and structural variations (SVs) among F. pseudograminearum strains were analyzed. The whole-genome SNP locus-based population classification mirrored the toxin chemotype (3AcDON and 15AcDON)-based classification, indicating the presence of genes associated with the trichothecene toxin gene cluster. Further analysis of differential SNP, indel, and SV loci between the 3AcDON and 15AcDON populations revealed a predominant connection to secondary metabolite synthesis genes. Notably, the majority of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster loci were located in SNP-dense genomic regions, suggesting high mutability and a possible contribution to F. pseudograminearum population structure and environmental adaptability. This study provides insightful perspectives on the distribution and evolution of F. pseudograminearum and for forecasting the spread of wheat FCR, thereby aiding in the development of preventive measures and control strategies. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plant Disease"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1145\/3641541","title":["Learning Failure-Inducing Models for Testing Software-Defined Networks"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8219-0466","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rapha\u00ebl","family":"Ollando","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9025-7173","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Seung Yeob","family":"Shin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1393-1010","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lionel C.","family":"Briand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lero SFI Centre for Software Research, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland and University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Software-defined networks (SDN) enable flexible and effective communication systems that are managed by centralized software controllers. However, such a controller can undermine the underlying communication network of an SDN-based system and thus must be carefully tested. When an SDN-based system fails, in order to address such a failure, engineers need to precisely understand the conditions under which it occurs. In this article, we introduce a machine learning-guided fuzzing method, named FuzzSDN, aiming at both (1)\u00a0generating effective test data leading to failures in SDN-based systems and (2)\u00a0learning accurate failure-inducing models that characterize conditions under which such system fails. To our knowledge, no existing work simultaneously addresses these two objectives for SDNs. We evaluate FuzzSDN by applying it to systems controlled by two open-source SDN controllers. Furthermore, we compare FuzzSDN with two state-of-the-art methods for fuzzing SDNs and two baselines for learning failure-inducing models. Our results show that (1)\u00a0compared to the state-of-the-art methods, FuzzSDN generates at least 12 times more failures, within the same time budget, with a controller that is fairly robust to fuzzing and (2)\u00a0our failure-inducing models have, on average, a precision of 98% and a recall of 86%, significantly outperforming the baselines.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.2196\/54501","title":["Understanding the Long Haulers of COVID-19: Mixed Methods Analysis of YouTube Content"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0483-4753","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexis","family":"Jordan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2419-0131","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Albert","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating global impact.

News sources received a greater share of negative comments. A few themes of these negative comments included Misinformation and disinformation and Issues with the health care system. Similarly, negative long hauler comments were organized into several themes, including Disillusionment with the health care system and Requiring more visibility.

Isolated anonychia associated with RSPO4 gene mutation is a recently described non-syndromic autosomal recessive condition. In this family, a 13-year-old girl presented with severe epidermolysis bullosa symptoms. Family history revealed milder but similar complaints in the siblings, and anonychia affecting all nails in the mother and maternal relatives. The father did not have any signs of DEB. Genetic testing revealed heterozygous c.6127G&amp;gt;A (p.Gly2043Arg) variant in the COL7A1 (NM_000094.4) gene, in the proband and her affected siblings. The variant was not detected in the mother or father, prompting investigation into parental mosaicism. Detection of the variant in sperm sample suggested paternal mosaicism. Additionally, RSPO4 gene (NM_001029871.4) was sequenced in the mother and two of her affected sisters for suspected non-syndromic isolated anonychia, revealing homozygous c.79+1G&amp;gt;A variant. Isolated nail disease in the mother was initially thought to be the result of DDEB nails-only subtype and the DEB in the children was inherited from the mother. However, further clinical and genetic investigation showed that the condition in the patient and her siblings arose from gonosomal mosaicism in the father and the nail phenotype in the mother is a separate coincidental condition.

Novel strategies for disrupting aflatoxin production, cultivating resilient crops, and detecting contaminated food are urgently needed. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of aflatoxin production is pivotal for targeted interventions to mitigate toxin accumulation in food and feed. The gene cluster responsible for aflatoxin biosynthesis encodes biosynthetic enzymes and pathway-specific regulators, notably AflR and AflS. While AflR, a DNA-binding protein, activates gene transcription within the cluster, AflS enhances aflatoxin production through mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this study, we developed protocols to purify recombinant AflR and AflS proteins and utilised multiple assays to characterize their interactions with DNA. Our biophysical analysis indicated that AflR and AflS form a complex. AflS exhibited no DNA binding capability on its own but unexpectedly reduced the DNA binding affinity of AflR. Additionally, we found that AflR achieves its binding specificity through a mechanism in which either two copies of AflR or its complex with AflS bind to target sites on DNA in a highly cooperative manner. The estimated values of the interaction parameters of AflR, AflS and DNA target sites constitute a fundamental framework against which the function and mechanisms of other aflatoxin biosynthesis regulators can be compared.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Biochemical Journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4417177\/v1","title":["Values of Lymphocyte-Related Ratios in Predicting the Clinical Outcome of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Receiving Intravenous Thrombolysis Based on Different Etiologies"],"author":[{"given":"Yongyu","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Keyang","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Lu","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Linhu","family":"Zhao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Chunyan","family":"Lei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Yu","family":"Gu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Xiaoyan","family":"Zhu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]},{"given":"Qionghua","family":"Deng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Background\n Previous studies confirmed that neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were related to the clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Although viral genome was intermittently detected in blood samples, nasal and\/or ocular swabs of vaccinated goats post challenge, viral RNA levels were significantly lower compared to unvaccinated control animals and vaccinated goats did not appear to excrete live virus. This protection, like the antibody response, was maintained at the same level for at least 15 months after vaccination. In addition, we showed that animals that have been vaccinated with the adenovirus-based vaccine can be revaccinated with the same vaccine after 12 months and showed an increased anti-PPRV antibody response after this boost vaccination. Such vaccines, which provide a DIVA capability, would therefore be suitable for use when the current live attenuated PPRV vaccines are withdrawn at the end of the ongoing global PPR eradication campaign.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["npj Vaccines"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1177\/21650799241253870","title":["Effects of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome on Quality of Life Among Airline Crew"],"author":[{"given":"Jung-Ha","family":"Kim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Nursing, Dong-A University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2504-0987","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Seunghye","family":"Choi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Nursing, Gachon University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Background: Interest in post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome following COVID-19 infection has been increasing. Maintaining quality of life (QoL) is vital for airline crews because they work in a special environment, where they are responsible for the passengers\u2019 safety. This study aims to closely investigate factors affecting the QoL of airline crews, including post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey, comprising 167 crews. Findings: Age-specific significant differences were observed in social, overall, and total QoL scores. The physical domain QoL was significantly higher in the cockpit crews than that in the cabin crews. Significant differences were found in psychological and overall QoL depending on years of continuous service. Social domain and environmental QoL were lower in those who had no symptoms after being diagnosed with COVID-19 than in those who were symptomatic. Among the participants, 4.2% had post-COVID-19 syndrome, indicating significant differences in the physical domain, depending on whether they exhibit post-COVID-19 syndrome. Conclusion: It is urgent to develop measures to increase the QoL of airline crews, investigate post-COVID-19 syndrome before returning to work, and develop strategies to manage it. Application to practice: The QoL among airline crews differed not only by the demographic characteristics of the participants but also by the presence of symptoms during COVID-19 diagnosis and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Higher QoL among airline crews is associated with the safety of both airline crews and passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic management protocol for airline crews returning to work after following COVID-19 infection. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Workplace Health &amp; Safety"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pgph.0003310","title":["Helminthiasis and malaria co-infection among women of reproductive age in a rural setting of Kilifi County, coastal Kenya: A mixed method study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6757-0989","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Janet","family":"Masaku","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Francis","family":"Mutuku","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jimmy H.","family":"Kihara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Charles","family":"Mwandawiro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Collins","family":"Okoyo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2509-8692","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Henry","family":"Kanyi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Joyce","family":"Kamau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lydia","family":"Kaduka","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zipporah","family":"Ng\u2019ang\u2019a","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Victor T.","family":"Jeza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH), <jats:italic>Schistosoma haematobium<\/jats:italic> and malaria co-infection lead to increased susceptibility to other infections and poor pregnancy outcomes among women of reproductive age (WRA).

Radar observations of winter storms often exhibit locally enhanced linear features in reflectivity, sometimes labeled as snow bands. We have developed a new, objective method for detecting locally enhanced echo features in radar data from winter storms. In comparison to convective cells in warm season precipitation, these features are usually less distinct from the background echo and often have more fuzzy or feathered edges. This technique identifies both prominent, strong features and more subtle, faint features. A key difference from previous radar reflectivity feature detection algorithms is the combined use of two adaptive differential thresholds, one that decreases with increasing background values and one that increases with increasing background values. The algorithm detects features within a snow rate field rather than reflectivity and incorporates an underestimate and overestimate of feature areas to account for uncertainties in the detection. We demonstrate the technique on several examples from the US National Weather Service operational radar network.

Fish responses (detections\u22c5individual\u22121\u22c5hr\u22121 within the 3 m exclusion zone) were quantified for a mixed assemblage of native and non-native fishes within 0.4 ha ponds. Additionally, we mapped the surface voltages generated by the electric barrier in a nearby stream. The electric barrier (operated at 10 kW) was effective at deterring native and invasive fishes, as &amp;gt; 99% of all fish detections within the exclusion zone occurred while the electric barrier was off. However, some fish detections occurred while the system was operated at full power, indicating the electric barrier was not 100% effective. A follow-up study found that fish responses differed between low (3.6 kW), medium (6.6 kW), and high (10 kW) field strengths, with Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus exhibiting a greater sensitivity to the low setting than Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix. Maps of the surface voltages within a nearby stream indicated that the electric barrier was strong enough to deter Silver Carp (&amp;gt; 1 V\/cm). However, the surface voltages quickly dissipated upstream and downstream of the electrodes. Overall, the electric barrier appears to be an effective tool that can be used to combat the spread of invasive fishes in freshwater environments. However, more evaluations are needed to test how the system performs in different conditions and to identify whether fish of varying sizes or life stages respond similarly.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1186\/s12917-024-04016-9","title":["Evaluation the kill rate and mutant selection window of danofloxacin against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in a peristaltic pump model"],"author":[{"given":"Hongjuan","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chengshui","family":"Liao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ke","family":"Ding","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Longfei","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lei","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p><jats:italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae<\/jats:italic> is a serious pathogen in pigs.

Sanxingdui, located on the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan and linked with the ancient Chinese Shu Kingdom, is one of the most distinctive archaeological sites in the world. However, despite its importance, the agricultural economy of the Sanxingdui culture and the Chengdu Plain remains poorly understood and heavily debated. This study synthesizes recent archaeological and historical evidence concerning the agricultural economy underpinning the increasing scale and social complexity at Sanxingdui and the greater Chengdu Plain prior to 2200 BP. Our analysis finds a mixed rice and dry-land millet farming economy, in conjunction with pig and chicken husbandry, during the Sanxingdui culture (3700\u20133100 BP). This integrated agricultural system likely began with the Baodun culture (4500\u20133700 BP), passing to the Sanxingdui culture (3700\u20133100 BP), Shierqiao culture (3100\u20132600 BP) and later, the Shu culture (2600\u20132300 BP). In addition, although gathering, hunting, and fishing accounted for relatively low proportions of the overall subsistence, the ancient peoples at Sanxingdui and across the Chengdu Plain continued these practices, supporting a diverse agricultural and food system. Understanding the subsistence at Sanxingdui offers key insights into the development of complex societies in southwest China, the contributions to Chinese culture, and the role of agriculture worldwide.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Land"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.51359\/2525-7668.2024.261535","title":["Reordenamentos da governamentalidade neoliberal e o neoconservadorismo em foco: efeitos na educa\u00e7\u00e3o dos g\u00eaneros e sexualidades"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7267-0076","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tamires Tolomeotti","family":"Pereira","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2137-7996","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jamil Cabral","family":"Sierra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Com base em aportes po\u0301s-estruturalistas, bem como dos estudos de g\u00eanero e nos estudos foucaultianos, este artigo investiga como se deu o reordenamento de uma governamentalidade neoliberal e seu entrela\u00e7amento com a governamentalidade neoconservadora, assim como seus efeitos no campo da educa\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente na educa\u00e7\u00e3o dos g\u00eaneros e sexualidades.

We address this question using the seed of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis as<\/jats:italic> a model system. We show that seeds first experience a phase of rapid anisotropic growth that is dependent on the response of cortical microtubule (CMT) to forces, which guide cellulose deposition according to shape-driven stresses in the outermost layer of the seed coat. However, at later stages of development, we show that seed growth is isotropic and depends on the properties of an inner layer of the seed coat that stiffens its walls in response to tension but has isotropic material properties. Finally, we show that the transition from anisotropic to isotropic growth is due to the dampening of cortical microtubule responses to shape-driven stresses.

When the freshwater of a river joins the saline water of an ocean, a transitional state of water is obtained. This zone of transition varies on the quantity of freshwater entering the ocean and the quality of both waters. Indus River is facing severe challenges due to climate change which has resulted in reduced water flow in the river. Consequently, seawater intrusion takes place which causes coastal erosion, stunted mangrove growth, and the narrowing of the river towards the seaside. The groundwater in the deltaic regions is unfit for drinking which forces an increased reliance on surface water. Sindh Province of Pakistan, particularly the coastal regions, suffers from severe water quality problems, affecting approximately 41% of the population. The population of this region is deprived of good-quality water for their daily use. This research aims to evaluate the physiochemical parameters of water in the Indus River to identify the zone of salinity inundation and determine safe zones for accessing surface water in the Indus Delta in the Sujawal district. Water samples were collected from Khobar Creek, ending in the Arabian Sea in the areas of Shah Bandar and Kharo Chan at an approximate interval of 5\u00a0km. These samples were analyzed for various physical and chemical properties. Properties were compared spatially to develop a relationship between distance and quality of water. Results indicate that the values of dissolved solids in collected samples are between 21,450 and 900\u00a0mg\/L, pH was between 6.66 and 7.63, conductivity of the samples varied from 33,000 to 1385\u00a0\u00b5S\/cm, acidity values were between 921.14 and 399.84\u00a0mg\/L, hardness was in the range of 3654 to 192\u00a0mg\/L, and the turbidity was in between 21 and57 NTU. It was revealed from the results that seawater is having a severe influence upto 15\u00a0km from the mouth of the creek in which not a single parameter except the pH was complying with WHO recommendations. In the interval of 15 to 30\u00a0km, some properties of water were complying with WHO recommendations, while some of them were deviating from the limits. It has been concluded that turbidity was improving while going toward the ocean, while Total Dissolved Solids, hardness, and chloride concentrations were increasing as water was getting closer to the sea while pH was found almost unaffected. The findings emphasize the need for addressing environmental degradation, social hardships, and economic challenges caused by these water quality issues. Ultimately, the quality of water is crucial for various activities specifically for drinking purposes, and its suitability for specific purposes is of utmost importance.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Discover Water"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/mp.17191","title":["The effects of back\u2010projection variants in BPF\u2010like TOF PET reconstruction using CNN filtration \u2013 Based on simulated and clinical brain data"],"author":[{"given":"Li","family":"Lv","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Biomedical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Gengsheng L.","family":"Zeng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Computer Science Utah Valley University  Orem USA"}]},{"given":"Gaoyu","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan\u2010Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China"},{"name":"Department of Automation Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Wenxiang","family":"Ding","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Biomedical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Fenghua","family":"Weng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Biomedical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Qiu","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Biomedical Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai China"},{"name":"Department of Nuclear Medicine Rui Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>The back\u2010projection strategies such as confidence weighting (CW) and most likely annihilation position (MLAP) have been adopted into back\u2010projection\u2010and\u2010filtering\u2010like (BPF\u2010like) deep reconstruction model and shown great potential on fast and accurate PET reconstruction.

To determine the degree to which this is grounded in business reality, a growing body of empirical studies have examined whether higher environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance predicts better financial performance. However, conflicting findings have emerged, with reviews highlighting the role that methodological choices, normative setting, and industry can play in moderating that relationship. Unlike other industries, health care has been the focus of only a handful of heterogeneous quantitative studies. To contribute to this evidence base for the European context, the present study comprehensively examined whether and how ESG score can influence both accounting\u2010 and market\u2010based measures of financial performance. Company data from the top health care companies listed in the STOXX 600 Index over the last decade (2012\u20132022) were gathered and analyzed. The analysis results confirmed that a marked heterogeneity of effects across the different ESG scores and measures of financial performance exists, which is not merely due to differences in empirical strategy, with modest positive effects being estimated in most cases. Of the three pillars, the governance score consistently predicted more positive financial performance among the sample of listed European companies. The environmental pillar score only influenced accounting\u2010based measures, though inconsistently, whereas the social pillar did not seem to have any predicting role for accounting\u2010based measures. Future research should consider replicating the proposed analytical framework in other data settings and normative contexts to strengthen the current evidence base and therefore deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the investigated relationships in the health care industry.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Strategic Change"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956332","title":["Supplementary Figure S3 from A Prospective Double-Blinded Comparison of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy with Conventional Histopathology for &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;\/i&gt; Assessment in Oral Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5240-8989","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniella K.","family":"Zanoni","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4316-8834","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paula","family":"Dem\u00e9trio De Souza Fran\u00e7a","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3397-2888","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cristina","family":"Valero","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0091-9602","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gary","family":"Peterson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5772-4937","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marco","family":"Ardigo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2802-8489","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ronald","family":"Ghossein","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0747-2479","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephen W.","family":"Dusza","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9490-3619","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Danielli","family":"Matsuura","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7784-1244","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniel W.","family":"Scholfield","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5555-2019","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dauren","family":"Adilbay","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1297-9469","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pablo H.","family":"Montero","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5882-0728","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jocelyn","family":"Migliacci","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1750-7436","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Naga Vara Kishore","family":"Pillarsetty","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3185-2639","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kivanc","family":"Kose","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7636-5426","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ian","family":"Ganly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6323-4547","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Milind","family":"Rajadhyaksha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9775-5132","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Snehal G.","family":"Patel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S3 shows in vivo RCM images of a tumor area in a 74-year-old male, with 35 packs\/years of smoking history and daily alcohol exposure.

ANN and MLR are feasible to use across the G7 countries' total energy production numbers, and these numbers were determined using ANN and MLR forecasting techniques. The data included the years 1990\u20132020, focusing on GDP intensity, refined oil product production, electricity production, and renewable energy proportion. In ANN modeling, the best regression results at 10*10 have been obtained with two hidden layers. All regression values were 0.99947, with the training regression value being 0.99912, the validation regression value being 0.99997, and the test regression value being 0.99997. The results showed high accuracy, with regression scores exceeding 99% and smaller prediction error values.

Urban flood risk models have been increasingly applied to assess impacts of urbanization on flood risk. For this purpose, different methodological approaches have been developed in order to reflect the complexity and dynamics of urban growth. To assess the state-of-the art in the application of flood risk models under urbanization scenarios, we conducted a structured literature review and systematically analyzed 93 publications with 141 case studies. Our review shows that hydrological and hydrodynamic flood models are the most commonly used approaches to project flood risk. Future urbanization is mostly considered as urban sprawl through the adjustment of land use maps and roughness parameters. A low number of approaches additionally consider transitions of urban structures and densification processes in their urbanization scenarios. High-resolution physically based flood models are constantly developed and already well suited for describing quantifiable processes in data-rich contexts. In regions with data paucity, however, we argue that a reduction of the level of detail in flood models accompanied by a higher resolved representation of urbanization patterns should be explored to improve the quality of flood risk projections under future urbanization trends. For this purpose, we also call for the development of integrative model structures such as causal network models that have greater explanatory power and enable the processing of qualitative data.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Environmental Research Letters"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1186\/s13102-024-00915-4","title":["Home-based circuit training improves blood lipid profile, liver function, musculoskeletal fitness, and health-related quality of life in overweight\/obese older adult patients with knee osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic"],"author":[{"given":"Sameer Badri","family":"Al-Mhanna","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alexios","family":"Batrakoulis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mahaneem","family":"Mohamed","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nouf H.","family":"Alkhamees","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bodor Bin","family":"Sheeha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zizi M.","family":"Ibrahim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abdulaziz","family":"Aldayel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ayu Suzailiana","family":"Muhamad","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shaifuzain Ab","family":"Rahman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hafeez Abiola","family":"Afolabi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maryam Mohd","family":"Zulkifli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Muhammad","family":"Hafiz bin Hanafi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bishir Daku","family":"Abubakar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Rojas-Valverde","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wan Syaheedah Wan","family":"Ghazali","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>There is strong evidence showing the association between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and knee pain resulting from osteoarthritis.

We test these models in periodic, and aperiodic conditions, and analyze the impact of assuming Gaussian priors on the estimates of the ensemble methods.

Nonetheless, the current pool of identified lncRNA linked to diseases remains restricted. Hence, the scientific community emphasizes the need for a reliable and cost-effective computational approach to predict the probable correlations between lncRNA and diseases. It would facilitate the exploration of the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA in ailments and the development of novel disease treatments. In this study, we propose a novel approach for predicting the associations between lncRNAs and diseases, which relies on the adaptive meta-path generation (AMPGLDA). Firstly, we integrate information about lncRNA, diseases, and miRNAs to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we utilize principal component analysis to extract global features from nodes. Based on this heterogeneous graph, AMPGLDA adaptively generates multiple meta-path graph structures and uses a graph convolutional neural network to learn the semantic feature representations of lncRNA and disease from the meta-path. Ultimately, AMPGLDA utilizes a deep neural network classifier to accurately predict the association between lncRNA and disease. The AMPGLDA model achieves impressive results, with AUC and AUPR scores of 99.66% and 99.66%, respectively, under the independent test set. Furthermore, three case studies demonstrate its accuracy in discovering new lncRNA-disease associations.

This study consisted of 3718 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u20132002. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between blood metals with hypertension, and the mediating model was used to evaluate the mediating effect of LTL. In the fully adjusted model, both blood lead and cadmium ln-transformed concentrations were significantly positively associated with hypertension risk, as were all quartiles of blood lead. Additionally, we observed positive linear dose\u2013response relationships with hypertension by restricted cubic spline analysis (both p overall &lt; 0.001, p non-linear = 0.3008 for lead and p non-linear = 0.7611 for cadmium). The ln-transformed blood lead and cadmium concentrations were associated with shorter LTL. LTL was inversely related to hypertension and the OR was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.89). Furthermore, LTL had mediating effects on the associations of blood lead and cadmium with hypertension risk, and the mediation proportions were 2.25% and 4.20%, respectively. Our findings suggested that exposure to lead and cadmium raised the risk of hypertension, while LTL played as a mediating factor.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Toxics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/yct.0000000000001027","title":["Successful Treatment of Both Refractory Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome and Subsequent Catatonia With Electroconvulsive Therapy in a Patient With Suspected Kufs Disease"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-1176-5319","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sacha","family":"Celik","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, H\u00f4pital du Valais, Sion, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Veronica","family":"de Gennaro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, H\u00f4pital du Valais, Sion, Switzerland"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-2214-9513","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jo\u00e3o","family":"C.-P.-Silva","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Old Age Psychiatry Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, H\u00f4pital du Valais, Sion, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Kevin","family":"Swierkosz-Lenart","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Old Age Psychiatry Service, Department of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland."}]},{"given":"Armin","family":"von Gunten","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Old Age Psychiatry Service, Department of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland."}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n          <jats:p>We describe a patient suffering from probable Kufs disease who developed a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) after use of an antipsychotic agent over some weeks during hospitalization due to neuropsychiatric symptoms.

This article discusses the latest research progress and guideline recommendations for nutritional support during ECMO. We summarize the nutritional status and evaluation of ECMO patients, nutritional support methods and timing, trace elements, the impact of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and energy requirements and algorithms. The article shows that malnutrition is high in ECMO patients compared to other critically ill patients, with nearly one-third of patients experiencing a decrease in nutritional indicators. The timing of the initiation of nutrition is very important for the nutritional status of the child. Early enteral nutrition can improve patient prognosis, which is the most commonly used, with parenteral nutrition as a supplement. However, the proportion of enteral nutrition is relatively low, and a stepwise nutrition algorithm can determine when to initiate early enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition. Malnourishment during critical illness have been associated with increased morbidity as well as increased mortality. Nutritional status should be evaluated at admission by screening tools. In addition, changes in the levels of several metabolites <jats:italic>in vivo<\/jats:italic>, such as blood lipids, carnitine, and thiamine, can also reflect the degree of nutritional deficiency in critically ill children.

The research takes into account three instances, each with its own unique combination of wind speed, ambient temperature, and sun irradiation. It has been shown that the solar radiation is a key component for growth in the PV temperature.

Furthermore, at an ambient temperature of 35\u00b0C, PCM is found to melt entirely in 435 min, whereas at an ambient temperature of 30\u00b0C, PCM melts up to a liquid fraction of 0.77 min.

While a limited number of studies have acknowledged the importance of top executives\u2019 strategy-making on firms\u2019 environmental performance, questions still persist regarding how the role structure of the top management team (TMT) promotes the disclosure of environmental policies, and subsequently enhances firm environmental performance. Based on the attention-based view and resource-dependency perspective, this study aims to examine how TMT functional diversity is beneficial for formulating better environmental disclosures, which in turn, is expected to increase environmental performance. Additionally, we explore the extent to which external resources (i.e., government subsidies) can strengthen this relationship. We employed an archival dataset from 406 Chinese manufacturing firms over a ten-year period (2010\u20132019) and tested a moderated mediation model. Our findings suggest that greater functional diversity within TMTs positively influences firm environmental performance through the improved environmental disclosures, and this indirect effect is amplified when firms receive higher levels of government subsidies. Our study contributes to the existing literature on environmental governance by demonstrating that (1) functional diversity within the TMT can predict more favorable environmental performance metrics; and (2) government financial support can particularly be a booster for the relationship between TMT environmental disclosures and firm environmental performance. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Group &amp; Organization Management"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fnut.2024.1352535","title":["Dietary choline intake and colorectal cancer: a cross-sectional study of 2005\u20132018 NHANES cycles"],"author":[{"given":"Xijuan","family":"Xu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hongan","family":"Ying","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lili","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Weiwen","family":"Hong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenbin","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>It remains unclear if choline intake is associated with colorectal cancer.

Cut-off Lows (COL) are mid-tropospheric cyclonic systems that frequently form over southern South America, where they can cause high-impact precipitation events. However, their prediction remains a challenging task, even in state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction systems. In this study, we assess the skill of the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) in predicting COL formation and evolution over the South American region where the highest frequency and intensity of such events is observed. The target season is austral autumn (March to May), in which the frequency of these events maximizes. Results show that GEFS is skillful in predicting the onset of COLs up to 3 days ahead, even though forecasts initialized up to 7 days ahead may provide hints of COL formation. We also find that as the lead time increases, GEFS is affected by a systematic bias in which the forecast tracks lay to the west of their observed positions. Analysis of two case studies provide useful information on the mechanisms explaining the documented errors. These are mainly related to the depth and the intensity of the cold core, which affect the thermodynamic instability patterns (thus shaping precipitation downstream) as well as the horizontal thermal advection which can act to reinforce or weaken the COLs. These results are expected to provide not only further insight into the physical processes at play in these forecasts, but also useful tools to be used in operational forecasting of these high-impact weather events over southern South America.\n                        <\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.06.01.596946","title":["Chromosome-level reference genome assembly for the protected resource plant, Zenia insignis"],"author":[{"given":"Si-Yun","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhi-Yun","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rong","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hui","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ting-Shuang","family":"Yi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Zenia insignis Chun, from the subfamily Dialioideae of Fabaceae, is a tree species of significant economic and ecological values.

Subsequent lipidomic analysis revealed that palmitate changed the composition of membrane phospholipids in endothelial cells and that these effects were not reverted upon application of above-mentioned inhibitors. However, ER stress inhibition in palmitate-treated cells enhanced the synthesis of trilglycerides and restored ceramide levels to control condition.

This study investigates how demographic factors, user satisfaction, trust, and the intention to use FinTech platforms intertwine among residents of Hyderabad and Secunderabad from March to May 2024. Through an analysis of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, education, and occupation, the study uncovers their influence on FinTech adoption and usage. Findings reveal that while age, education, and gender do not significantly impact FinTech adoption, employment status and income levels emerge as critical determinants, with employed individuals and those in lower-income brackets showing higher adoption rates. Moreover, the study underscores the pivotal role of user satisfaction and trust in driving continued engagement with FinTech services. Positive user experiences are found to be instrumental in building trust, which strongly influences the intention to use FinTech platforms. However, user satisfaction alone does not significantly impact usage intentions without the presence of trust. These insights underscore the importance of transparent and secure service offerings to cater to diverse consumer needs and foster widespread adoption, ensuring the sustained success of FinTech initiatives.

The seed of the plant is especially enriched in several bioactive molecules including polyphenols, saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids and has demonstrated potential to act as an antidiabetic phytotherapeutic. A novel patented formulation (Fenfuro\u00ae) was developed in our laboratory from the fenugreek seeds which contained &gt;45% furostanolic saponins (HPLC).\r\nObjective:\u00a0A placebo-controlled clinical compliance study was designed to assess the effects of complementing Fenfuro\u00ae\u00a0on a randomized group of human volunteers on antidiabetic therapy (Metformin and sulphonylurea) in controlling the glycemic index along with simultaneous safety assessment.\r\nStudy methodology and trial design:\u00a0In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 42 individuals (21 male and 21 female volunteers) in the treatment group (out of 57 enrolled) and 39 individuals (17 male and 22 female volunteers) in the placebo group (out of 47 enrolled), all on antidiabetic therapy with Metformin\/Metformin with sulphonyl urea within the age group of 18\u201365 years were administered either 1,000 mg (500 mg \u00d7 2) (Fenfuro\u00ae) capsules or placebo over a period of 12 consecutive weeks. Fasting and postprandial glucose along with glycated hemoglobin were determined as primary outcomes to assess the antidiabetic potential of the formulation. Moreover, in order to evaluate the safety of the formulation, C-peptide and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels as well as immunohematological parameters were assessed between the treatment and placebo groups at the completion of the study.\r\nResults:\u00a0After 12 weeks of administration, both fasting as well as postprandial serum glucose levels decreased by 38 and 44% respectively in the treatment group. Simultaneously, a significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin by about 34.7% was also noted. The formulation did not have any adverse effect on the study subjects as there was no significant change in C- peptide level and TSH level; liver, kidney, and cardiovascular function was also found to be normal as assessed by serum levels of key immunohematological parameters. No adverse events were reported.\r\nConclusion:\u00a0This clinical compliance study re-instated and established the safety and efficacy of Fenfuro\u00ae\u00a0as an effective phytotherapeutic to treat hyperglycemia.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Food &amp; Nutrition Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/5t42s","title":["Is there a poverty of the stimulus?

Then, we introduce the notions of developmental linearities and non-linearities by reviewing seminal work on non-human-animal models of ontogeny from ethology and comparative psychology. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work on the POS argument: we conclude that resilient, species-typical outcomes which, superficially, would appear to require a form of \u201cinnate\u201d knowledge, may, ultimately, reflect non-obvious forms of experience that occur within a broader, reoccurring developmental system.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.06.03.596211","title":["Estimation of free-roaming dog populations using Google Street View: A Validation Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0001-9107-2143","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Guillermo","family":"Porras","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elvis W.","family":"Diaz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Micaela","family":"De la Puente","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Cesar M.","family":"Gavidia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6629-2139","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ricardo","family":"Castillo-Neyra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Free-roaming dogs play a central role in carrying zoonotic pathogens such as rabies virus, Echinococcus granulosus, and Leishmania spp. The control and elimination of these pathogens require quantitative knowledge of dog populations. Thus, estimating the dog population is fundamental for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health programs. However, dog population estimation is time-consuming, requires many field personnel, may be inaccurate and unreliable, and is not without danger. Our objective was to validate a remote methodology for estimating the population of free-roaming dogs using Google Street View (GSV). Our target populations were free-roaming dogs from Arequipa, Peru, a rabies-affected area. Adopting a citizen science approach, and using social media, we recruited online citizen scientists from Arequipa and other regions and trained them to use GSV to identify and count free-roaming dogs in 26 urban and periurban communities. We used correlation metrics and negative binomial models to compare the counts of dogs identified in the GSV imagery with accurate counts of free-roaming owned dogs estimated via door-to-door surveys. In total, citizen scientists detected 868 dogs using GSV and using door-to-door surveys we estimated 909 free-roaming dogs across those 26 communities (Pearson's coefficient was r=0.73, p &lt; 0.001). Our model predicted that for each free-roaming dog detected with GSV in urban areas, there were 1.03 owned dogs with free access to the street (p &lt; 0.001). The type of community, urban versus periurban, did not have an important effect on the model, but fitting the models in periurban communities was difficult because of the sparsity of high-resolution GSV images in those areas. Using GSV imagery for estimating dog populations is a promising tool in urban areas.

It aims to enhance the accuracy of nominally nonpolarizable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for interactions in biologically relevant systems involving water, ions, proteins, lipids, and saccharides. Recognizing the inherent limitations of nonpolarizable force fields in precisely modeling electrostatic interactions essential for various biological processes, we mitigate these shortcomings by accounting for electronic polarizability in a physical rigorous mean-field way that does not add to computational costs. With this scaling of (both integer and partial) charges within the CHARMM36 framework, prosECCo75 addresses overbinding artifacts. This improves agreement with experimental ion binding data across a broad spectrum of systems - lipid membranes, proteins (including peptides and amino acids), and saccharides - without compromising their biomolecular structures. prosECCo75 thus emerges as a computationally efficient tool providing enhanced accuracy and broader applicability in simulating the complex interplay of interactions between ions and biomolecules, pivotal for improving our understanding of many biological processes.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1007\/s41685-024-00343-9","title":["Total factor productivity and institutional quality in Vietnam: which institutions matter most?"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9616-3290","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Van","family":"Ha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0598-2253","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John","family":"Andre","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anh Tran","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hien Nguyen Thi","family":"Thu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The roles of institutional quality\u2019s impact on firm performance are becoming increasingly prominent in the literature. This is true in the Global North and South. Vietnam has seen less research on this topic than other developing countries, so this paper seeks to rectify this by examining whether or not institutional quality influences firm performance, as measured by total factor productivity (TFP). This paper also digs deeper into the sub-components to see which institutions are the most influential. We applied the General Method of Moments (GMM) approach to a firm-level panel dataset covering the 2010\u20132020 period to examine institutional quality's impact on firm TFP. Results are explored by firm size and by ownership type (domestic private, foreign and state-owned). Using rich datasets covering institutional quality at the provincial level in Vietnam and also individual firm performance from 2010 to 2020, we found that Time cost (how long it takes firms to deal with the government on various issues) and Labor policy (how easy it is to hire good quality labor) are the most important of the 10 institutions studied. Additionally, while not all institutions influence TFP, institutional quality overall (all 10 institutions combined) clearly has a positive influence on TFP. This study fills a research gap by examining the relationship between institutional quality and firm performance in Vietnam. The findings emphasize the significance of Time cost and Labor policy as influential institutions and highlight the positive overall impact of institutional quality on TFP.

Moreover, some such fallacies have managed to colonise the human mind and become cultural representations in society today. Adopting the approach I advocate here, we could say that the fallacy has become a belief, which has then managed to replicate like a virus, and finally the fallacy has become a cultural representation.

Knowledge covering diverse cellular and molecular data from individual patients has become valuable for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Here, we present in-depth comparative RNA-seq analysis of 32 CRC patients pairing tumor and healthy tissues (total of 73 samples). Strict thresholds for differential expression genes (DEG) analysis revealed an interconnection between nutrients, metabolic program, and cell cycle pathways. Among the upregulated DEGs, we focused on the Xc- system, composed of the proteins from SLC7A11 (xCT) and SLC3A2 genes, along with several interacting genes. To assess the oncogenic potency of the Xc- system in a cellular setting, we applied a knowledge-based approach, analyzing gene perturbations from CRISPR screens. The study focused on a set of 27 co-dependent genes that were strongly correlated with the fitness of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 across many cell types. Alterations in these genes in 13 large-scale studies (e.g., by mutations and copy number variation) were found to enhance overall survival and progression-free survival in CRC patients. In agreement, the overexpression of these genes in cancer cells drives cancer progression by allowing effective management of the redox level, induction of stress response mechanisms, and most notably, enhanced activity of ion\/amino acid transporters, and enzymes acting in de novo nucleotide synthesis. We also highlight the positive correlation between the Xc- system gene expression level, patient responsiveness to different chemotherapy treatments, and immune cell infiltration (e.g., myeloid-derived suppressor cells) in CRC tumors as a measure for their immunosuppressive activity. This study illustrates that knowledge-based interpretation by synthesizing multiple layers of data leads to functional and mechanistic insights into the role of SLC7A11 and its associated genes in CRC tumorigenesis and therapeutics.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000010371","title":["Factors Associated With Head and Neck Polytrauma Presentation and Admissions at Emergency Departments of Varying Sizes"],"author":[{"given":"Joshua S.","family":"Lin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Caruso Department of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}]},{"given":"Paul","family":"Won","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"}]},{"given":"Matthew E.","family":"Lin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"}]},{"given":"Oluwatobiloba","family":"Ayo-Ajibola","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"}]},{"given":"Neil N.","family":"Luu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Caruso Department of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}]},{"given":"Alexander","family":"Markarian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Caruso Department of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}]},{"given":"Roxana","family":"Moayer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Caruso Department of Otolaryngology\u2013Head and Neck Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Timely diagnosis of acute head and neck polytrauma presenting to emergency departments (EDs) optimizes outcomes.

This study is relevant because in the modern pedagogical process the emphasis on the integration of national cultural features, including music, is becoming increasingly important. It promotes multicultural education and the development of students\u2019 national identity. The purpose of this study was to develop ways to integrate the musical culture of the Kyrgyz people into modern pedagogical education and recommendations for their optimisation. The following methods were used in the study: analytical, specifically, historical analysis; comparative; method of synthesis; as well as methods of generalisation and systematisation. The most revealing was the historical analysis, through which the historical context of the development of Kyrgyz musical culture and its influence on education in different periods of history was studied. The results of the study suggested that the inclusion of elements of musical culture of the Kyrgyz people in the pedagogical process can serve as an effective tool for the development of students\u2019 cultural self-awareness, as well as the development of their emotional and social competence. However, to achieve the best results, clearly formulated methods are needed that consider the specifics of Kyrgyz musical culture and the features of the modern pedagogical process. Among such techniques, the following were identified: cultural immersion, integrated lessons, project-oriented method, organisation of creative working groups, case method, creation of interactive music laboratories, differentiated approach, and application of the method of critical analysis in lessons. The findings of this study can be useful for teachers, students at pedagogical universities, researchers in the field of pedagogy and ethnomusicology, as well as educational authorities.\n\n      <\/jats:p>","container-title":["ASIAN-EUROPEAN MUSIC RESEARCH JOURNAL"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1038\/s41467-024-49069-4","title":["Quantitative prediction of rate constants and its application to organic emitters"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1835-0418","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Katsuyuki","family":"Shizu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5111-3852","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hironori","family":"Kaji","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Many phenomena in nature consist of multiple elementary processes. If we can predict all the rate constants of respective processes quantitatively, we can comprehensively predict and understand various phenomena. Here, we report that it is possible to quantitatively predict all related rate constants and quantum yields without conducting experiments, using multiple-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR\u2013TADF) as an example. MR\u2013TADFs are excellent emitters because of its narrow emission, high luminescence efficiency, and chemical stability, but they have one drawback: slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), leading to efficiency roll-off and reduced device lifetime. Here, we show a quantum chemical calculation method for quantitatively obtaining all the rate constants and quantum yields. This study reveals a strategy to improve RISC without compromising other important factors: radiative decay rate constants, photoluminescence quantum yields, and emission linewidths. Our method can be applied in a wide range of research fields, providing comprehensive understanding of the mechanism including the time evolution of excitons.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nature Communications"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.20517\/jca.2024.06","title":["Cardiomyocyte senescence and the potential therapeutic role of senolytics in the heart"],"author":[{"given":"Peiyong","family":"Zhai","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Junichi","family":"Sadoshima","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Cellular senescence in cardiomyocytes, characterized by cell cycle arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, occurs during aging and in response to various stresses, such as hypoxia\/reoxygenation, ischemia\/reperfusion, myocardial infarction (MI), pressure overload, doxorubicin treatment, angiotensin II, diabetes, and thoracic irradiation. Senescence in the heart has both beneficial and detrimental effects. Premature senescence of myofibroblasts has salutary effects during MI and pressure overload. On the other hand, persistent activation of senescence in cardiomyocytes precipitates cardiac dysfunction and adverse remodeling through paracrine mechanisms during MI, myocardial ischemia\/reperfusion, aging, and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Given the adverse roles of senescence in many conditions, specific removal of senescent cells, i.e., senolysis, is of great interest. Senolysis can be achieved using senolytic drugs (such as Navitoclax, Dasatinib, and Quercetin), pharmacogenetic approaches (including INK-ATTAC and AP20187, p16-3MR  and Ganciclovir, p16 ablation, and p16-LOX-ATTAC and Cre), and immunogenetic interventions (CAR T cells  or senolytic vaccination).

RoPod comprises a dedicated protocol for plant cultivation and a customizable 3D-printed vessel with integrated microscopy-grade glass that serves simultaneously as a growth and imaging chamber. RoPod reduces impact of sample handling, preserves live samples for prolonged imaging sessions, and facilitates application of treatments during image acquisition. We describe a protocol for RoPods fabrication and provide illustrative application pipelines for monitoring root hair growth and autophagic activity. Furthermore, we showcase how the use of RoPods advanced our understanding of plant autophagy, a major catabolic pathway and a key player in plant fitness. Specifically, we obtained fine time resolution for autophagy response to commonly used chemical modulators of the pathway and revealed previously overlooked cell type-specific changes in the autophagy response. These results will aid a deeper understanding of the physiological role of autophagy and provide valuable guidelines for choosing sampling time during end-point assays currently employed in plant autophagy research.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Scientific Reports"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/dug2.12103","title":["Numerical study on gas production via a horizontal well from hydrate reservoirs with different slope angles in the South China Sea"],"author":[{"given":"Tingting","family":"Luo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-8793-2101","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jianlin","family":"Song","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou China"}]},{"given":"Xiang","family":"Sun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics Chinese Academy of Sciences Wuhan China"}]},{"given":"Fanbao","family":"Cheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of Ministry of Education Dalian University of Technology Dalian China"}]},{"given":"Madhusudhan","family":"Bangalore Narasimha Murthy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Engineering and the Environment University of Southampton Southampton UK"}]},{"given":"Yulu","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou China"}]},{"given":"Yi","family":"Zhao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering China University of Mining and Technology Xuzhou China"}]},{"given":"Yongchen","family":"Song","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of Ministry of Education Dalian University of Technology Dalian China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>It is important to study the effect of hydrate production on the physical and mechanical properties of low\u2010permeability clayey\u2013silty reservoirs for the large\u2010scale exploitation of hydrate reservoirs in the South China Sea.

Besides, the mean effective stress of reservoirs is concentrated in the near\u2010wellbore area with the on\u2010going hydrate production, and gradually decreases with the increase of the slope angle. Different from the effective stress distribution law, the total reservoir settlement amount first decreases and then increases with the increase of the slope angle.

The pathway\u2010based gene network analysis method utilizes each pathway as a unit, overcoming the limitations of traditional strategies for detecting selection signatures by revealing the selection of complex biological processes. Here, we utilized 13\u2009122\u2009398 high\u2010quality SNPs from whole\u2010genome sequencing data of 48 Pietrain pigs, 156 Duroc pigs and 36 European wild boars to detect selective signatures. After calculating <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub> and iHS scores, we integrated the pathway information and utilized the <jats:sc>r\/bioconductor graphite<\/jats:sc> and <jats:sc>signet<\/jats:sc> packages to construct gene networks, identify subnets and uncover candidate genes underlying selection. Using the traditional strategy, a total of 47 genomic regions exhibiting parallel selection were identified. The enriched genes, including <jats:italic>INO80<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>FZR1<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>LEPR<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>FAF1<\/jats:italic>, may be associated with reproduction, fat deposition and skeletal development.

The wisdom in research on ethnicity is that it is a troublemaker disrupting programmatic politics, prioritizing group identity over ideology, polity over policy, principle over compromise. Ethnicity is expected to be a source of particularistic tension. This book takes a theoretical step back. Approaching ethnic politics as normal politics, it investigates the ideological potential of ethnicity. The book seeks to answer central questions: What are the political preferences of ethnic minorities and their representatives and how are they translated into political representation? How does this shape political competition, and with what systemic effects? The book proceeds from the expectation that ethnic minorities seek group preservation. While group preservation is best ensured via group sovereignty, this is often unlikely. Most ethnic minorities face low chances of achieving group sovereignty, and, consequently, they remain as permanent minorities. This book demonstrates that permanent minorities search for group preservation by championing liberal rights that would protect them from the tyranny of the majority. This translates into broader ideological preferences and political behavior, inducing the formation of liberal political poles. This dynamic is system forming, as it configures political cleavages, shapes party systems, and informs the absorption of new political issues. Ultimately, the presence of ethnic minorities can be a force for liberal democracy. Simultaneously, ethnic liberalism is circumstantial, as conditional factors cross-pressure the ethnic minority search for rights and liberties, potentially attenuating ethnic liberalism and inducing exclusionary particularism. The book combines the study of ethnic politics with research on electoral behavior and party competition, while studying minorities in eastern Europe in comparison with majorities. The book utilizes existing data, and collects new evidence, which it analyses using mixed experimental, quantitative, and qualitative methods. Its empirical chapters are divided into two parts, one focusing on large-N comparative analyses, and one carrying out three in-depth case studies on interwar Czechoslovakia, and contemporary Slovakia and Estonia.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1111\/cch.13289","title":["Role of projective psychological tests in patients with Prader\u2010Willi syndrome"],"author":[{"given":"Yohanna","family":"Gonzalez\u2010Ruiz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Mental Health, SPINE Foundation  Buenos Aires Argentina"}]},{"given":"Anabela","family":"Galiana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Mental Health, SPINE Foundation  Buenos Aires Argentina"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8833-2939","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jorgelina","family":"Stegmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Medicine, SPINE Foundation  Buenos Aires Argentina"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction<\/jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and relevance of projective techniques such as house\u2010tree\u2010person (HTP) and family in individuals with Prader\u2010Willi syndrome (PWS), who have a limited ability to identify and verbalize emotions and express them often using behaviors.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>We included individuals with genetic confirmation of PWS immersed in a regular transdisciplinary treatment in an institution dedicated to rare diseases.

Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow the capture of high-resolution snapshots of cell states as they transition along temporal trajectories. Using these high-throughput datasets, we can train computational models to generate in silico synthetic cells that faithfully mimic the temporal trajectories. Here we present OneSC, a platform that can simulate synthetic cells across developmental trajectories using systems of stochastic differential equations govern by a core transcription factors (TFs) regulatory network. Different from the current network inference methods, OneSC prioritizes on generating Boolean network that produces faithful cell state transitions and steady cell states that mimic real biological systems. Applying OneSC to real data, we inferred a core TF network using a mouse myeloid progenitor scRNA-seq dataset and showed that the dynamical simulations of that network generate synthetic single-cell expression profiles that faithfully recapitulate the four myeloid differentiation trajectories going into differentiated cell states (erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes and monocytes). Finally, through the in-silico perturbations of the mouse myeloid progenitor core network, we showed that OneSC can accurately predict cell fate decision biases of TF perturbations that closely match with previous experimental observations.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1017\/thg.2024.24","title":["Association Between Rheumatoid Arthritis and Clonal Hematopoiesis: A Mendelian Randomization Study"],"author":[{"given":"Jie","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chun","family":"Zhou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1881-9543","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shaoxing","family":"Guan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>Immunity activation and inflammation are the main characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis and clonal hematopoiesis.

Summary statistics data of rheumatoid arthritis (13,838 cases and 33,742 controls) and clonal hematopoiesis (10,203 cases and 173,918 controls) derived from a genomewide association study were selected to analyze.

Thermal diffusivity (\u03b1) and conductivity (\u03ba) of SAC155-xNi gradually decreased with increasing temperature in the range from 303 to 423\u00a0K and\/or Ni content in alloys. The measured values of (\u03ba) are slightly lower than the computed value at similar temperatures of the SAC155-xNi alloys. The decrease in (\u03ba) may be assigned to scattering the electrons or reducing the phonon contributions due to the presence of various solute atoms and different IMCs. The results of stress-strain graphs reveal the enhancement of YS and UTS for all Ni-containing alloys. The improvement of the yield stress (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of Ni-containing alloys is attributed to the uniform distribution of the IMCs, the reduction of \u03b2-Sn grain size, and the smoothed enlargement of the eutectic region.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/adfm.202314439","title":["Advances in Engineering Toolkits for Construction of Ultralow Disordered Van der Waals Heterostructures"],"author":[{"given":"Zhujun","family":"Huang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Electrical and Computer Engineering New York University  Brooklyn New York 11201 USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5955-1830","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Davood","family":"Shahrjerdi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Electrical and Computer Engineering New York University  Brooklyn New York 11201 USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The exploration of emerging quantum phenomena by stacking dissimilar atomic layered materials into van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has driven the development of layer assembly techniques.

The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of physical activity in patients with advanced cancer undergoing systemic treatment and its relationship with sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors. A prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study was carried out in 15 oncology departments in Spain. Patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic cancer who were candidates for systemic treatment were included. Participants completed demographic information and psychological scales. In total, 508 patients were included in the study, the majority of whom were male, over the age of 65, and diagnosed with bronchopulmonary tumors (36%) and metastatic disease. Based on their physical activity levels, participants were categorized as sedentary (20%, n = 190), engaging in light physical activity (43%, n = 412), or demonstrating moderate physical activity (37%, n = 351). Patients who were over 65 years old; had a worse baseline status (ECOG \u2265 1); lacked a partner; had a lower educational level; or were retired or unemployed were found to have lower levels of physical activity. Those with sedentary physical activity reported higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and physical symptoms, as well as worse functional status, global health status, and well-being. Understanding the complex interplay between physical activity and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors can help neuroscientists develop tailored exercise interventions that address the unique needs of advanced cancer patients.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Brain Sciences"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4446588\/v1","title":["Knowledge Graph Decision Transformer:Conditional sequence decision-making model for Offline RL integrated with knowledge graph"],"author":[{"given":"Shan","family":"He","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Southwest Petroleum University"}]},{"given":"Zhaoyang","family":"Lu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Southwest Petroleum University"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Decision Transformer is one of the representative algorithms in the field of offline reinforcement learning for conditional sequence modeling. It can learn from past decisions and predict future action strategies, performing well in most tasks. However, recent research indicates its limitations in concatenating different trajectory segments, meaning it struggles to utilize suboptimal trajectories effectively. This paper combines Decision Transformer with knowledge graph link prediction, leveraging the strengths of both methods to enhance decision-making in complex environments. While Decision Transformer provides a robust framework for handling sequential data, knowledge graph link prediction offers structured representations of entity relationships and predicts potential links between entities, allowing the model to infer unobserved state transitions. By integrating knowledge graph predictions into the Decision Transformer model, we can enhance decision accuracy by leveraging additional contextual and relational information. This synergy enables more effective utilization of available data and better adaptation to diverse scenarios.

In Romania, about 31% of the buildings date from before 1961, contributing to the current stock of old buildings with historic and architectural value in the country. This paper illustrates the current state of buildings with historic and architectural value in Romania, alongside a case study of a representative administrative building in C\u00e2mpulung, Romania. The analysis of the Town Hall building in C\u00e2mpulung, Romania, demonstrates that potential energy savings of up to 47.53% can be achieved by implementing interventions such as upgrading windows, insulating the attic, and installing photovoltaic panels. The highest energy reduction is obtained by replacing the window glass with a value of 18.16% with attic insulation with a value of 16.1%. This paper also presents indoor measurements of temperature and humidity in different offices positioned in the north and the south. The study conducted on the south fa\u00e7ade office revealed consistent temperatures ranging from 21.7 \u00b0C to 24.4 \u00b0C, with an average of 23.31 \u00b0C. However, the humidity levels fluctuated considerably, ranging from 17.1% to 39.1%, with an average of 26.89%. The sun-exposed section of the building saw relatively stable temperature conditions, but the varying humidity levels could have a detrimental impact on the quality of the indoor atmosphere and potentially decrease the effectiveness of the workforce. By contrast, the north fa\u00e7ade office exhibited lower and more fluctuating temperatures, ranging from 19.8 \u00b0C to 23.6 \u00b0C, with an average of 21.74 \u00b0C. Additionally, it had higher and more stable humidity levels, ranging between 19.5% and 41.7%, with an average of 29.83%. A thermographic analysis was performed on the north fa\u00e7ade of the C\u00e2mpulung Town Hall, utilizing thermal imaging technology to detect areas of heat loss, and thus identifying the energy inefficiency problems of the building\u2019s exterior.

The double product (DP) acts as an index for myocardial oxygen oxygen demand, derived from the multiplication of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Pulse Rate (PR). This research aimed to explore the association between high myocardial oxygen demand and extended hospital stays among acute ischemic stroke patients in Indonesia. Methods. This study was a retrospective cohort study carried out from January 2022 to December 2022 at a regional referral hospital located in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants were chosen consecutively until the necessary sample size was achieved. Information extracted from medical records encompassed baseline socio demographic and clinical variables. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed, along with multivariate analysis utilizing cox proportional hazards, to determine the correlation between elevated myocardial oxygen demand index and length of hospital stay (LOS). Results. A total of 366 patients were included, with a mean age of 60.05 \u00b1 10.41 years, and 60.4% were male. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.4 \u00b1 3.55 days. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between high myocardial oxygen demand index (RR 3.184, 95% CI 1.097-9.258, p=0.028), sepsis (RR 1.942, 95% CI 1.024-4.145, p=0.045), and severe anemia (RR 2.610, 95% CI 1.291-1.465, p=0.036) with prolonged length of stay. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the high myocardial oxygen demand group had a significantly higher association with prolonged length of stay compared to the normal to low myocardial oxygen demand group (RR 2.116, 95% CI , p=0.035) after controlling for sepsis and severe anemia variables. Conclusions. The High Myocardial Oxygen Demand Index is significantly correlated with extended length of stay among patients with acute ischemic stroke, both before and after adjusting for other potential

replicative stress is a potent tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be kept in check for cancer cells to thrive. Thus, the identification of genes and pathways involved in replicative stress is key to understand cancer evolution and to identify prospective therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated factors that modulate replicative stress upon deregulation of the MYC oncogene. We identified the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK12 as selectively required to prevent transcription-replication conflicts and the activation of a cytotoxic DNA-damage response (DDR). At the mechanistic level, CDK12 was recruited to damaged genes by PARP-dependent DDR-signaling and elongation-competent RNAPII. Once recruited, CDK12 repressed transcription by preventing the association of CDK9 with RNAPII. Either loss or chemical inhibition of CDK12 led to DDR-resistant transcription at damaged genes. Genome-wide profiling revealed that loss of CDK12 exacerbated transcription-replication conflicts in MYC-overexpressing cells and led to the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), occurring preferentially between early-replicating regions and transcribed genes, organized in a co-directional head-to-tail orientation. Overall, our data demonstrate that CDK12 protects genome integrity by repressing transcription of damaged genes, which is required for proper resolution of DSBs at oncogene-induced transcription-replication conflicts. This provides a rationale that explains both how CDK12 deficiency can promote tandem duplications of early-replicated regions during tumor evolution, and how CDK12 targeting can exacerbate replicative-stress in tumors.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.05.31.596824","title":["The tumor-maintaining function of UTX\/KDM6A in DNA replication and the PARP1-dependent repair pathway"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5895-1269","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shu-Ping","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lin-Wen","family":"Yeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Je-Wei","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jia-Yun","family":"Yeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mei-Han","family":"Kao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hsiao-Chin","family":"Hong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sean","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wai-Mui","family":"Cheung","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ta-Yu","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marvin Angelo E.","family":"Aberin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ernesto","family":"Paas-Oliveros","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Arian","family":"Escajeda","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Edward","family":"Shih","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Woan-Yuh","family":"Tarn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yao-Ming","family":"Chang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lan-Hsin","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (aka KDM6A) is mutated in many human cancers, suggesting its tumor suppressive role during cancer development. However, most tumors still express wild-type UTX\/KDM6A and its function is not always linked to tumor suppression. Here, we present evidence of UTX\/KDM6A's role in sustaining tumor growth, revealing its function in tumor maintenance. We find that UTX\/KDM6A sustains tumor cell cycling and survival via regulating DNA replication-associated transcriptional programs in a demethylase-independent manner. UTX\/KDM6A can also interact with PARP1 and facilitate its recruitment to DNA lesions. Therefore, UTX\/KDM6A depletion disrupts DNA replication and repair pathways, activating ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1 signaling pathways and triggering S and G2\/M checkpoints, leading to a pronounced defect in tumor growth. Analysis of human cancer xenograft models further demonstrates that knockdown of UTX\/KDM6A by RNA-interference, rather than inhibition of its enzymatic activity via GSK-J4, shows potent anticancer effects. Dual inhibition of UTX\/KDM6A and ATR further demonstrates synergistic anticancer activities. Our work highlights UTX\/KDM6A as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially when combined with ATR inhibition.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.31980\/caxra.v2i2.844","title":["ANALISIS PEMBELAJARAN PENDIDIKAN AGAMA ISLAM KURIKULUM 2013 BAGI ANAK BERKEBUTUHAN KHUSUS DI SDLB 01 REJANG LEBONG"],"author":[{"given":"Zahratul","family":"Fitria","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"family":"Sukiman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.Zaidul","family":"Kirom","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Tujuan dari penelitian untuk menganalisis suatu kurikulum yang saat ini digunakan yakni kurikulum 2013 pada materi pendidikan agama islam yang mana penelitian ini berfokus pada anak yang memiliki kebutuhan khusus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that MM is twice as common in Black Americans as in White Americans. Understanding these racial disparities is paramount to addressing potential healthcare biases and developing targeted interventions to ensure equitable patient care and outcomes. Methods Using the \"All of Us\" database from the National Institute of Health, we performed a retrospective study on 413,457 participants. Of these, 1,430 were diagnosed with MM. We examined the factors contributing to racial disparities in MM risk using multivariable statistical analysis, including interaction effects. Results To comprehensively account for the multidimensional aspects of self-reported race followed by the CDC, we incorporated genetic ethnicity, demographics (age, gender), body mass index, social determinants of health (zipcode's deprivation index, and health insurance status), and common pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure - CHF, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) into our analysis. Our findings reveal that the racial disparities in health outcomes between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White individuals, as reported by the CDC, are driven by a synergistic epistatic interaction between having African as a predominant genetic ethnicity and being diagnosed or treated for hypertension (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.54 to 5.57, P = 0.001). This interaction is also true for individuals whose primary genetic ancestry is Ad Mixed American (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.2, P = 0.044). The other variables significantly associated with MM risk are having a predominant genetic ancestry of Ad Mixed American (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.85, P = 0.017), the lack of health insurance (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.93, P = 0.017), zipcode's deprivation index being above the US median (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.53, P = 0.018), being diagnosed with CHF before MM (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.56 to 2.72, P &lt; 1.e-3), being male (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.46, P = 0.031), and being over the age of 65 (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.36 to 2, P &lt; 1.e-3). Conclusion These findings reveal a previously unknown epistatic interaction between an individual's predominant genetic ancestry and hypertension, responsible for the CDC-reported higher risk of the African-American population for MM. In other words, hypertension serves as a surrogate marker for a genetic predisposition in individuals with a predominant African genetic ancestry. This insight could improve the screening and identification of minority individuals at risk for MM.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1001\/jamanetworkopen.2024.13515","title":["Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring With Social Support for Patients With Hypertension"],"author":[{"given":"Shivan J.","family":"Mehta","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Kevin G.","family":"Volpp","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Andrea B.","family":"Troxel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York"}]},{"given":"Joseph","family":"Teel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Catherine R.","family":"Reitz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Alison","family":"Purcell","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Humphrey","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Kiernan","family":"McNelis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"Christopher K.","family":"Snider","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"}]},{"given":"David A.","family":"Asch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Care Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia"},{"name":"Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, Philadelphia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Importance<\/jats:title><jats:p>Hypertension management has traditionally been based on office visits.

Increased spatial variability in salt marshes at the landscape scale has been used to quantify the propagation of ponding in salt marsh interiors, but ponding at the landscape scale follows a state change rather than predicts it. Here, we suggest a novel application of commonly collected surface elevation table (SET) data and explore millimeter-scale marsh surface microtopography as a potential early indicator of ecosystem transition. We find an increase in spatial variability using multiple metrics of microtopographic heterogeneity in vulnerable salt marsh communities across the North American Atlantic seaboard. Increasing microtopographic heterogeneity in vulnerable salt marshes mirrored increasing trends in variance when a tipping point is approached in other alternative stable state systems \u2014 indicating that early warning signals of marsh drowning and ecosystem transition are observable at small-spatial scales prior to runaway ecosystem degradation. Congruence between traditional and novel metrics of marsh vulnerability suggests that microtopographic metrics can be used to identify hidden vulnerability before widespread marsh degradation.

This review delves into the application of AFM in non-clinical settings, where it characterizes molecular, cellular, and tissue-level aspects of neurological disorders in experimental models. This includes studying ion channel distribution, neuron excitability in genetic disorders, and axonal resistance to mechanical injury. In the clinical context, this article emphasizes AFM\u2019s potential in early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), through biomarker characterization in biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and blood. It also examines the use of AFM in enhancing the grading and treatment of CNS tumours by assessing their stiffness, providing a more detailed analysis than traditional histopathological methods. Despite its promise, this review acknowledges challenges in integrating AFM into clinical practice, such as sample heterogeneity and data analysis complexity, and discusses emerging solutions such as machine learning and neural networks to overcome these hurdles.

Ocean acidification (OA) is predicted to cause profound shifts in many marine ecosystems by impairing the ability of calcareous taxa to calcify and grow and by influencing the physiology of many others. In both calcifying and non-calcifying taxa, ocean acidification could further impair the ability of marine life to regulate internal pH and thus metabolic function and\/or behaviour. Identifying tipping points at which these effects will occur for different taxa due to the direct impacts of ocean acidification on organism physiology is difficult because they have not adequately been determined for most taxa nor for ecosystems at higher levels. This is due to the presence of both resistant and sensitive species within most taxa. However, calcifying taxa such as coralline algae, corals, molluscs, and sea urchins appear to be most sensitive to ocean acidification. Conversely, non-calcareous seaweeds, seagrasses, diatoms, cephalopods, and fish tend to be more resistant or even benefit from the direct effects of ocean acidification, though the effects of ocean acidification are more subtle for these taxa. While physiological tipping points of the effects of ocean acidification either do not exist or are not well defined, their direct effects on organism physiology will have flow-on indirect effects. These indirect effects will cause ecological tipping points in the future through changes in competition, herbivory, and predation. Evidence for indirect effects and ecological change is mostly taken from benthic ecosystems in warm temperate\u2013tropical locations in situ that have elevated CO2. Species abundances at these locations indicate a shift away from calcifying taxa and towards non-calcareous taxa at high-CO2 concentrations. For example, lower abundance of corals and coralline algae and higher covers of non-calcareous macroalgae, often turfing species, are often found at elevated CO2. However, there are some locations where only minor changes or no detectable changes occur. Where ecological tipping points do occur, it is usually at locations with naturally elevated mean pCO2 concentrations of 500\u2009\u00b5atm or more, which also corresponds to just under that concentration where the direct physiological impacts of ocean acidification are detectable in the most sensitive taxa in laboratory research (coralline algae and corals). Collectively, the available data support the concern that ocean acidification will most likely cause ecological change in the near future in most benthic marine ecosystems, with tipping points in some ecosystems as low as 500\u2009\u00b5atm pCO2. However, further research is required to more adequately quantify and model the extent of these impacts in order to accurately project future marine ecosystem tipping points under ocean acidification.\n                    <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Earth System Dynamics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1785\/0220240060","title":["A Seismic Nodal Deployment to Understand Magmatic Structure in the Vicinity of the P\u0101hala Earthquake Swarm"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1425-7969","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Helen","family":"Janiszewski","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"1Department of Earth Sciences, University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101Gnoa, Honolulu, Hawai\u2018i, U.S.A."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3230-6744","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ninfa","family":"Bennington","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"2U.

The P\u0101hala swarm, located south of Mauna Loa and K\u012blauea, has been the site of a multiyear sustained swarm of seismicity at the depths of \u223c25\u201340\u00a0km, with order of magnitude increases in rate in 2015, and then again in 2019. This seismicity is possibly related to the input of magma from the mantle plume below, which may then be subsequently transported to volcanic edifices. However, these processes remain enigmatic, in part due to a lack of precise earthquake locations and seismic velocity models in this region. Here, we provide an overview of the deployment, an assessment of the quality of the collected data, and discuss the viability of the data set for local earthquake relocation, tomography, and teleseismic receiver functions. Through comparisons with proximal permanent broadband and short-period instruments, we find that the nodes produce high-quality data, particularly at periods shorter than 5\u00a0s, although we find, document, and correct discrepancies with the gain and polarities of the instruments. We successfully record signals from teleseismic earthquakes, even at periods longer than 5\u00a0s (the corner of the flat response of the nodes). We also record local earthquakes, including details related to source characteristics. This indicates that the data are likely to prove useful for investigations using both local and teleseismic earthquake signals to better understand the connections between the deep and shallow magmatic systems of Hawai\u2018i. Although this deployment provides a snapshot in time, its success may provide a useful benchmark for future studies as the volcanic systems of Hawai\u2018i continue to evolve in the future.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Seismological Research Letters"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/ijms25116163","title":["Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in an Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia-like Pediatric Case of Multiple Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations"],"author":[{"given":"Laura","family":"Lorente-Herraiz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas Margarita Salas, CIB-CSIC, 28040 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6596-9600","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Angel M.","family":"Cuesta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria del Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos (IdISSC), 28040 Madrid, Spain"}]},{"given":"Luc\u00eda","family":"Recio-Poveda","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas Margarita Salas, CIB-CSIC, 28040 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6310-2245","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Luisa M.","family":"Botella","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas Margarita Salas, CIB-CSIC, 28040 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain"}]},{"given":"Virginia","family":"Albi\u00f1ana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas Margarita Salas, CIB-CSIC, 28040 Madrid, Spain"},{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), ISCIII, 28029 Madrid, Spain"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are vascular anomalies resulting in abnormal connections between pulmonary arteries and veins. In 80% of cases, PAVMs are present from birth, but clinical manifestations are rarely seen in childhood. These congenital malformations are typically associated with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), a rare disease that affects 1 in 5000\/8000 individuals. HHT disease is frequently caused by mutations in genes involved in the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. However, approximately 15% of patients do not have a genetic diagnosis and, among the genetically diagnosed, more than 33% do not meet the Cura\u00e7ao criteria. This makes clinical diagnosis even more challenging in the pediatric age group. Here, we introduce an 8-year- old patient bearing a severe phenotype of multiple diffuse PAVMs caused by an unknown mutation which ended in lung transplantation. Phenotypically, the case under study follows a molecular pattern which is HHT-like. Therefore, molecular- biological and cellular-functional analyses have been performed in primary endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the explanted lung. The findings revealed a loss of functionality in lung endothelial tissue and a stimulation of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

The Alentejo region, Portugal, is an area with a high presence of olive groves, which in 2022 accounted for 201,474 hectares. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between olive pollen, weather data, and olive tree production, between the years 2002 and 2022. Pollen data were obtained from an urban station located in \u00c9vora, in the Alentejo region, and were used to calculate several metrics, such as the Pollen Season Duration (PSD), Seasonal Pollen Index (SPIn), peak value, and weekly pollen accumulation values. Monthly minimum, maximum, and mean temperature and precipitation sums were obtained from the E-OBS observational dataset. Considering the relationship between pollen\/weather and olive production, mutual information and correlation analyses were conducted. Subsequently, several machine learning algorithms were trained using pollen and weather datasets, and we obtained suitable forecast models for olive tree production after cross-validation. The results showed high variability in pollen concentrations in \u00c9vora over the years. Complex associations were found, with certain weeks of pollen accumulation showing significant mutual information with olive production, particularly during June. The analyzed linear correlation coefficients remained generally low, underscoring the challenge of predicting olive production based on linear relationships.

Populations confined to watersheds of the North coast of the Sea of Okhotsk (Palana and Okhota rivers), along with island populations, displayed noteworthy distinctions from the isolated population complexes. We hypothesize that the marked divergence observed in island populations is primarily caused by genetic drift occurring during long periods of isolation. The pronounced divergence of Palana River population may be the result of both genetic drift and natural selection, driven by the challenging smoltification and juvenile transition to the ocean, along with local adaptations during spawning and early life periods in the Palansky Lake.

However, most extant approaches assume highly diverse collections of mixtures and extremely low-loss spectroscopic measurements. Additionally, current non-Bayesian frameworks do not incorporate the uncertainty inherent in unmixing. We propose a probabilistic inference algorithm that explicitly incorporates noise and uncertainty, enabling us to unmix endmembers in collections of mixtures with limited diversity. We use a Bayesian mixture model to jointly extract endmember spectra and mixing parameters while explicitly modeling observation noise and the resulting inference uncertainties. We obtain approximate distributions over endmember coordinates for each set of observed spectra while remaining robust to inference biases from the lack of pure observations and the presence of non-isotropic Gaussian noise. As a direct impact of our methodology, access to reliable uncertainties on the unmixing solutions would enable robust solutions to noise, as well as informed decision-making for HSI applications and other unmixing problems.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Applied Sciences"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1017\/s0047279424000035","title":["Fostering societal participation of marginalised people in street-outreach services in the Netherlands"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3221-7840","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Evelien","family":"Rauwerdink-Nijland","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Linda","family":"van den Dries","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Judith","family":"Metz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Arnoud","family":"Verhoeff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Judith","family":"Wolf","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>Marginalisation is a multilevel phenomenon in society depriving people from essential rights, resources, and opportunities.

Actin cytoskeleton destruction in the seminiferous epithelium is one of the important reasons for BPA\u2010induced spermatogenesis disorder. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Herein, we explored the role and mechanism of Rsad2, an interferon\u2010stimulated gene in BPA\u2010induced actin cytoskeleton disorder in mouse GC\u20102 spermatocyte cell lines. After BPA exposure, the actin cytoskeleton was dramatically disrupted and the cell morphology was markedly altered accompanied by a significant increase in Rsad2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in GC\u20102 cells. Furthermore, the phalloidin intensities and cell morphology were restored obviously when interfering with the expression of Rsad2 in BPA\u2010treated GC\u20102 cells. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in intracellular ATP levels after BPA treatment, while the ATP level was obviously upregulated when knocking down the expression of Rsad2 in BPA\u2010treated cells compared to cells treated with BPA alone. Moreover, Rsad2 relocated to mitochondria after BPA exposure in GC\u20102 cells. BPA promoted Rsad2 expression by activating type I IFN\u2010signaling in GC\u20102 cells. In summary, Rsad2 mediated BPA\u2010induced actin cytoskeletal disruption in GC\u20102 cells, which provided data to reveal the mechanism of BPA\u2010induced male reproductive toxicity.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Applied Toxicology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/healthcare12111138","title":["An Overview of Opioid Prescription Patterns among Non-Opioid Users Following Emergency Department Admission"],"author":[{"given":"Miriam","family":"Zeino","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3284-0285","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Romain","family":"L\u00e9guillon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"},{"name":"Laboratoire d\u2019Informatique M\u00e9dicale et d\u2019Ing\u00e9nierie des Connaissances en e-Sant\u00e9 (LIMICS), U1142, IN-9 SERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, F-75005 Paris, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5398-0722","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pauline","family":"Brevet","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CIC-CRB 1404, Department of Rheumatology, CHU Rouen, University Rouen Normandie, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"Baptiste","family":"Gerard","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Rheumatology, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"Catherine","family":"Chenailler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3035-2149","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Johanna","family":"Raymond","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"Lucas","family":"Bibaut","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Rheumatology, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"Sophie","family":"Pouplin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Rheumatology, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"Luc Marie","family":"Joly","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine Department, Universitary Hospital of Rouen, University Rouen Normandy, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"given":"R\u00e9mi","family":"Varin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5300-6244","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eric","family":"Barat","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmacy, Rouen University Hospital, F-76000 Rouen, France"},{"name":"Department of Public Health, Normandie University UNICAEN, Inserm U1086, F-14000 Caen, France"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The evolving landscape of opioid prescription practices necessitates a comprehensive understanding of emerging patterns, particularly among new opioid users discharged from emergency departments.

We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with TTP and antibodies anti-ADAMTS13, showing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of pulmonary, hepatic, and splenic lesions initially reported as ischemic\/inflammatory changes. A follow-up MRI of the abdomen revealed increased evidence of the liver lesions, focal intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, splenic lesions, and enlarged hepatic hilar nodes. The follow-up chest CT showed increased evidence of the parenchymal lung consolidations. Given the radiological persistence of those alterations and the history of TTP, the hypothesis of an IgG4-related disease was then made. The IgG4 levels were found to be normal, while the histological examination of the liver revealed non-necrotizing granulomatous chronic inflammation. Elevated levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme were found, and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was negative for tuberculosis infection. Thus, the overall clinical picture was consistent with multisystemic sarcoidosis (alveolar, hepatic, and splenic). The diagnosis of sarcoidosis, already challenging due to the variability of its clinical presentation, can become even more complicated when it manifests with uncommon haematological manifestations such as TTP, along with non-specific extra-pulmonary involvement.

To do this, we configured a method in three moments: the search, evaluation, selection, and organization of the sources found and reading, analyzing, and writing results. The results highlight a regional and temporal interest that prioritizes teaching practice.

This paper investigates the application of these advanced technologies in real-time disease detection, showcasing their potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery. Smart healthcare systems leverage a multitude of technological components, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI), to enable continuous monitoring and diagnostics. This real-time monitoring facilitates prompt interventions and treatment adjustments, which is particularly advantageous for managing chronic conditions and acute illnesses where timely responses are critical to improving patient outcomes. Despite the evident benefits, traditional healthcare infrastructures face significant challenges such as delays in diagnosis due to manual processes, inefficient data handling resulting in data silos, and limited interoperability between different healthcare providers, leading to worsened health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. The integration of ML and big data analytics offers promising solutions to these challenges. ML algorithms can process vast amounts of healthcare data to identify patterns and predict outcomes with high accuracy, such as recognizing early signs of diseases like cancer or diabetes from medical images or electronic health records (EHRs). Big data analytics complements ML by providing the necessary infrastructure to handle and process large volumes of health data, enabling the collection, storage, and analysis of structured data from EHRs, unstructured data from clinical notes, and real-time data from wearable devices. By integrating these technologies, healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into patient health trends and outcomes, leading to more informed decision-making and better patient management. This study employs a qualitative research design, focusing on five genuine case studies: the Mayo Clinic's predictive analytics for heart disease, Cleveland Clinic's use of ML for cancer diagnosis, Kaiser Permanente's diabetes management program, Johns Hopkins Hospital's sepsis detection system, and Mount Sinai Health System's genomic data analysis. Each case study is chosen for its relevance and comprehensive data, detailing the specific healthcare environment and context. This paper interprets these findings in the broader context of smart healthcare systems and existing literature, emphasizing the importance of these technologies in modernizing healthcare and addressing inefficiencies. The challenges encountered during integration, such as data privacy concerns and interoperability issues, are examined along with implemented solutions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Global Mainstream Journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/nr9.0000000000000062","title":["Digital twin prevalence in the medical caring fields: a bibliomatrics study and visualization analysis via CiteSpace"],"author":[{"given":"Ting Ting","family":"Zhou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang, 550004, CHINA"}]},{"given":"Ping","family":"Gong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang, 550004, CHINA"}]},{"given":"Yin Ying","family":"Tian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intensive Care Unit, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang, 550004, CHINA"}]},{"given":"Meng Ting","family":"Su","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Breast and thyroid department of Guiqian International General Hospital, Guiyang, 550024, CHINA"}]},{"given":"Xing Yang","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Burn and plastic surgery, The First People\u2019s Hospital of Guiyang, Guiyang, 550016, CHINA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Objectives:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We conducted academic research utilizing the visualization tool CiteSpace to explore the direct relationship between digital twin technology and medical care.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We collected data from the Web Of Science Core Collection, PubMed ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library databases from 2010-2023, displayed visualization analysis of countries, institutions, and co-occurring keywords, cluster, citation bursts and timeline, also calculated nodes, edges, centrality, modularity and silhouette via CiteSpace 5.75r version.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The data incorporated 1109 studies, graphed the yearly publication number from 2010-2023, showed a steady increase trend.

Local gamma event coupling FC (GEC-FC) is believed to represent multiunit fluctuations due to inhibitory dysfunction, and we hypothesized that FC derived from widespread, broadband amplitude signal (BBA-FC) would be different, reflecting broader mechanisms of functional disconnection. We tested this during sleep and active periods defined by high delta and theta EEG activity, respectively, at 1,7 and 28d after rat fluid-percussion-injury (FPI) or sham injury (n=6\/group) using 10 indwelling, bilateral cortical and hippocampal electrodes. We also measured seizure and high-frequency oscillatory activity (HFOs) as markers of electrophysiological burden. BBA-FC analysis showed early hyperconnectivity constrained to ipsilateral sensory-cortex-to-CA1-hippocampus that transformed to mainly ipsilateral FC deficits by 28d compared to shams. These changes were conserved over active epochs, except at 28d when there were no differences to shams. In comparison, GEC-FC analysis showed large regions of hyperconnectivity early after injury within similar ipsilateral and intrahemispheric networks. GEC-FC weakened with time, but hyperconnectivity persisted at 28d compared to sham. Edge- and global connectivity measures revealed injury-related differences across time in GEC-FC as compared to BBA-FC, demonstrating greater sensitivity to FC changes post-injury. There was no significant association between sleep fragmentation, HFOs, or seizures with FC changes. The within-animal, spatial-temporal differences in BBA-FC and GEC-FC after injury may represent different mechanisms driving FC changes as a result of primary disconnection and interneuron loss.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.c.7265813.v1","title":["Data from Best Overall Response\u2013Associated Signature to Doxorubicin in Soft Tissue Sarcomas: A Transcriptomic Analysis from ANNOUNCE"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2800-077X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jiangang","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6514-2419","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David S.","family":"Moura","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4173-3844","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robin L.","family":"Jones","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4800-4046","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Amit","family":"Aggarwal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8945-2948","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Philip J.","family":"Ebert","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4384-9448","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andrew J.","family":"Wagner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-5298-6369","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jennifer","family":"Wright","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7350-6916","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Javier","family":"Martin-Broto","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7779-2796","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"William D.","family":"Tap","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;AbstractPurpose:&lt;p&gt;This exploratory analysis evaluated the tumor samples of the patients treated with doxorubicin (with or without olaratumab) in a negative phase III ANNOUNCE trial to better understand the complexity of advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and to potentially identify its predictive markers.&lt;\/p&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;p&gt;RNA sequencing was performed on pretreatment tumor samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;\/i&gt; = 273) from the ANNOUNCE trial to evaluate response patterns and identify potential predictive treatment markers for doxorubicin. A BOR-associated signature to doxorubicin (REDSARC) was created by evaluating tumors with radiographic response versus progression. An external cohort of doxorubicin-treated patients from the Spanish Group for Research on Sarcomas (GEIS) was used for refinement and validation.&lt;\/p&gt;Results:&lt;p&gt;A total of 259 samples from the trial were considered for analysis.

There were no associations between the BOR signature and gender, age, ethnicity, or stage. Applied to survival outcomes, REDSARC was also predictive for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Gaining insight into pathways\/proteins that increase venetoclax sensitivity or unique vulnerabilities in venetoclax-resistant DLBCL would provide new potential treatment avenues. Therefore, we generated acquired venetoclax-resistant DLBCL cells and evaluated these together with intrinsically venetoclax-resistant and -sensitive DLBCL lines. We identified resistance mechanisms, including alterations in BCL2 family members that differed between intrinsic and acquired venetoclax resistance and increased dependencies on specific pathways. Although combination treatments with BCL2 family member inhibitors may overcome venetoclax resistance, RNA-sequencing and drug\/compound screens revealed that venetoclax-resistant DLBCL cells, including those with TP53 mutation, had a preferential dependency on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I inhibition induced venetoclax-resistant, but not venetoclax-sensitive, DLBCL cell death. Inhibition of IDH2 (mitochondrial redox regulator) synergistically overcame venetoclax resistance. Additionally, both acquired and intrinsic venetoclax-resistant DLBCL cells were similarly sensitive to inhibitors of transcription, B-cell receptor signaling, and class I histone deacetylases. These approaches were also effective in DLBCL, follicular, and marginal zone lymphoma patient samples. Our results reveal there are multiple ways to circumvent or overcome the diverse venetoclax resistance mechanisms in DLBCL and other B-cell lymphomas and identify critical targetable pathways for future clinical investigations.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cancers"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-024-61466-9","title":["Aloe-inspired eco-friendly synthesis of Ag\/ZnO heterostructures: boosting photocatalytic potential"],"author":[{"given":"Nawal","family":"Ansar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wajeehah","family":"Shahid","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Muhammad Atif","family":"Irshad","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Samiah","family":"Shahid","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rab","family":"Nawaz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ali","family":"Irfan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Muhammad Iftikhar","family":"Khan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Aamal A.","family":"Al-Mutairi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maria","family":"Khizar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sami A.","family":"Al-Hussain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sana","family":"Ullah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Magdi E.

Early detection is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, performing total body screening (TBS), i.e., identifying suspicious lesions or ugly ducklings (UDs) by visual inspection, can be challenging and often requires sound expertise in pigmented lesions. To assist users of varying expertise levels, an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tool was developed. Our solution identifies and characterizes UDs from real-world wide-field patient images. It employs a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to locate and isolate all skin lesions present in a patient\u2019s total body images. These lesions are then sorted based on their level of suspiciousness using a self-supervised AI approach, tailored to the specific context of the patient under examination. A clinical validation study was conducted to evaluate the tool\u2019s performance. The results demonstrated an average sensitivity of 95% for the top-10 AI-identified UDs on skin lesions selected by the majority of experts in pigmented skin lesions. The study also found that the tool increased dermatologists\u2019 confidence when formulating a diagnosis, and the average majority agreement with the top-10 AI-identified UDs reached 100% when assisted by our tool. With the development of this AI-based decision support tool, we aim to address the shortage of specialists, enable faster consultation times for patients, and demonstrate the impact and usability of AI-assisted screening.

To gain new insights into the pathogenesis of SMA, we investigated the relationship between the immune system and erythropoiesis, conducting comparative analyses in a mouse model of malaria. Red blood cell (RBC) production was evaluated in infected and reinfected animals to mimic endemic occurrences. Higher levels of circulating EPO were observed in response to (re)infection.

Concomitantly, a pronounced immune response activation was observed in erythropoietic organs of reinfected animals in relation to single-infected mice. Aged mice were also used to mimic the occurrence of malaria in the elderly. The increase in symptom severity was correlated with the enhanced activation of the immune system, which significantly impaired erythropoiesis. Immunocompromised mice further support the existence of an immune-shaping regulation of RBC production.

Using single\u2010cell RNA\u2010sequencing (scRNA\u2010Seq), the authors show that TRIM24 overexpression impacts both intratumoral heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment. Mechanically, HRas<jats:sup>V12<\/jats:sup> activates phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (PHAX)\u00a0and upregulates U3 small nucleolar RNAs (U3 snoRNAs) to recruit Ku\u2010dependent DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA\u2010PKcs). Overexpressed TRIM24 is also recruited by PHAX to U3 snoRNAs, thereby facilitating DNA\u2010PKcs phosphorylation of TRIM24 at S767\/768 residues. Phosphorylated TRIM24 induces epigenome and transcription factor network reprogramming and promotes Ep\u2010GBM\u2010like transformation.

This process is critical for the normal hemostatic response, but especially under inflammatory conditions, it is thought to be a major player in pathological thrombus formation. For this reason, VWF has been the target for the development of anti\u2010thrombotic therapeutics. However, it is challenging to prevent pathological thrombus formation while still allowing normal physiological blood coagulation, as currently available anti\u2010thrombotic therapeutics are known to cause unwanted bleeding, in particular intracranial hemorrhage. This work explores the possibility of inhibiting VWF selectively under the inflammatory conditions present during pathological thrombus formation. In particular, the A2 domain of VWF is known to inhibit the neighboring A1 domain from binding to the platelet surface receptor GpIb\u03b1, and this auto\u2010inhibitory mechanism has been shown to be removed by oxidizing agents released during inflammation. Hence, finding drug molecules that bind at the interface between A1 and A2 only under oxidizing conditions could restore such an auto\u2010inhibitory mechanism. Here, by using a combination of computational docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy perturbation calculations, a ligand from the ZINC15 database was identified that binds at the A1A2 interface, with the interaction being stronger under oxidizing conditions.

Our aim was to present the missing mathematical-statistical assessment of the emotional response and psycho-physiological state of civilians who, from the first day of the war, were in Kharkiv, constantly under Russian-aggressor fire.\r\nMethods: 585 Kharkiv participants were tested using the only possible means accepted during constant rocket attacks and hostilities (visual psychodiagnostics methods).\r\nResults: Negative mental manifestations and the disability of Kharkivites to manage their psycho-emotional state have been established. Their evolution has been traced. The time stages of the participants\u2019 states were identified and characterized. Nearly all participants demonstrated intense stress-induced arousal and psycho-emotional incapacity\/inability. Psychotrauma also developed among Kharkivites, who constantly monitored military events through social Internet networks. Children were the most susceptible to all severe sensations.\r\nConclusions: The identified conditions are dangerous because they lead to pathological neurological-somatic disorders, psycho-emotional incapacity, or disability due to the stress-induced somatic-physiological destruction of the body. To normalize the psycho-emotional self-awareness and to help the participants get out of a stressful state, various preventive-rehabilitation means were used.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of

The first makes use of computer generated vortex holograms installed in the transmitting and receiving modules of the systems, which make it possible to generate and separate communication channels formed by vortex beams with different topological charges. The second method, spatial singular multiplexing, is based on the property of singular beams to restore angular momentum when vortex beams propagate in a medium with physical disturbances. The method uses opaque screens installed in the transmitting block of the system, which diaphragm the vortex beams. As a result of this operation, the centers of the vortices in the receiving part of the system are displaced, which makes it possible to separate the beams that are differently blocked in the transmitting unit.&amp;#xD;<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Optics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.05.30.596743","title":["Extracellular Respiration is a Latent Energy Metabolism in<i>Escherichia coli<\/i>"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2550-4585","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Biki Bapi","family":"Kundu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jayanth","family":"Krishnan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Richard","family":"Szubin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Arjun","family":"Patel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bernhard O.","family":"Palsson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniel C.","family":"Zielinski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Caroline M.","family":"Ajo-Franklin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Diverse microbial species utilize redox shuttles to exchange electrons with their environment through mediated extracellular electron transfer (EET). This process maintains redox homeostasis and supports anaerobic survival across diverse microbial communities. Although mediated EET has been extensively leveraged for bioelectrocatalysis and bioelectronics for decades, fundamental questions remain about how these redox shuttles are reduced within cells and their bioenergetic implications. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the physiological roles of mediated EET in various microbes and hampers the development of efficient microbial electrochemical technologies. To address this, we developed a methodology integrating genome editing, electrochemistry, and systems biology to investigate the mechanism and bioenergetic implications of mediated EET in bacteria. Using this approach, we uncovered a mediated EET mechanism in<jats:italic>Escherichia coli<\/jats:italic>. In the absence of alternative electron sinks, the redox cycling of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ) via a cytoplasmic nitroreductase enabled<jats:italic>E. coli<\/jats:italic>to respire and grow on an extracellular electrode. Genome-scale metabolic modeling suggested that HNQ-mediated EET offers a more energetically favorable route for supporting anaerobic growth than canonical fermentation. Transcriptome analysis revealed redox perturbations in response to HNQ and identified rapid metabolic adaptations that support growth.

In recent years, semaglutide has garnered significant attention as the only injectable and orally administered glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). However, it is important to note that different routes of administration may lead to varying adverse events in patients. The aim of this study is to compare the adverse event profiles of semaglutide across different routes of administration by analyzing the adverse event reporting system of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The findings from this analysis will provide valuable insights for clinical practice and drug surveillance.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>Data was extracted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, specifically focusing on the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2023. A comparative analysis was conducted using disproportionality analysis, reporting odds ratio (ROR), and stratified analysis methods to assess and compare the signals of adverse events (AE) and the time to onset of adverse reactions associated with different routes of administration of semaglutide from 2017 to 2023.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results<\/jats:title><jats:p>A total of 22,287 adverse reaction records related to semaglutide were identified in the FAERS database.

Different routes of administration can lead to varying adverse reaction outcomes. Compared to oral administration, subcutaneous injection is more likely to result in adverse events related to the endocrine system. Oral administration is more likely to induce adverse events in the gastrointestinal system. Additionally, it significantly accelerates the onset of adverse reactions. The comparative analysis of all relevant results indicates that semaglutide can lead to different adverse reaction events depending on the route of administration. Furthermore, there are significant differences in the time of onset for these adverse reactions.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title><jats:p>Semaglutide exhibits variations in adverse reaction events and the time of onset across different routes of administration.

Research focuses on improving the uniformity of the illumination obtained from diffractive optical elements in the THz range. The structures are designed with a modified Ping-Pong algorithm and a neural network-based solution. This method allows for the improvement of uniform illumination distribution with the desired shape. Additionally, the phase modulations of the structures are divided into segments, each responsible for imaging at different distances. Various segment combination methods are investigated, differing in shapes, image plane distances, and illumination types. The obtained image intensity maps allow for the identification of the performance of each combination method. Each of the presented structures shows significant improvements in the uniformity of imaged targets compared to the reference Ping-Pong structure.

In dealing with legal authorities such as in determining marriage guardians, determining the period of 'iddah and pregnant marriages, the headmen in Ternate and Tidore generally use Fiqh legal considerations rather than state laws such as KHI and so on.

This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into the advanced effects of combining FO or its components of DHA and EPA with natural products on protecting cognitive function. In two double-blind random control trials, no advanced effects were observed for adding curcumin to FO on cerebral function protection. However, 16 week\u2019s treatment of FO combined with vitamin E did not yield any advanced effects in cognitive factor scores. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that combinations of FO with natural products can exhibit advanced effects in addressing pathological components in cognitive impairment, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal survival. In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials for beneficial use of FO and natural ingredients combination is lacking.

The aim of this study is to propose a Deep Leaning (DL) approach able to quickly generate synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images from low-dose Cone Beam CT (CBCT) acquired on a modern linear accelerator integrating AI. Methods: A total of 53 patients treated in the pelvic region were enrolled and split into training (30), validation (9), and testing (14). A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was trained for 200 epochs. The image accuracy was evaluated by calculating the mean and mean absolute error (ME and ME) between sCT and CT. RT treatment plans were calculated on CT and sCT images, and dose accuracy was evaluated considering Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) and gamma analysis. Results: A total of 4507 images were selected for training. The MAE and ME values in the test set were 36 \u00b1 6 HU and 7 \u00b1 6 HU, respectively. Mean gamma passing rates for 1%\/1 mm, 2%\/2 mm, and 3%\/3 mm tolerance criteria were respectively 93.5 \u00b1 3.4%, 98.0 \u00b1 1.3%, and 99.2 \u00b1 0.7%, with no difference between curative and palliative cases. All the DVH parameters analysed were within 1 Gy of the difference between sCT and CT. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that sCT generation using the DL approach is feasible on low-dose CBCT images.

Locally administered immunosuppression strategies have shown promising results to bypass this hurdle. Nevertheless, their progress has been slow, partially attributed to a limited understanding of the essential mechanisms underlying graft rejection. Recent discoveries highlight the crucial involvement of innate immune components, such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in organ transplantation.

Graft rejection was evaluated macroscopically while the complement system, T cells, neutrophils and NETs were analyzed in graft tissues by immunofluorescence and\/or western blot. Plasmatic levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured using a Luminex magnetic-bead porcine panel, and NETs were measured in plasma and tissue using DNA-MPO ELISA.

Yet, tissue analysis showed local infiltration of T cells and neutrophils, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in rejected grafts. Interestingly, intra-graft administration of tacrolimus contributed to a reduction in both T-cellular infiltration and NETs.

Conversely, unsupervised learning techniques can leverage abundant unlabeled text data to learn rich representations, but they do not directly optimize for specific NLP tasks. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that synergizes unsupervised and supervised learning to improve the accuracy of NLP task modeling. While supervised models excel at specific tasks, they rely on large labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques can learn rich representations from abundant unlabeled text but don't directly optimize for tasks. Our methodology integrates an unsupervised module that learns representations from unlabeled corpora (e.g., language models, word embeddings) and a supervised module that leverages these representations to enhance task-specific models [4]. We evaluate our approach on text classification and named entity recognition (NER), demonstrating consistent performance gains over supervised baselines. For text classification, contextual word embeddings from a language model pretrain a recurrent or transformer-based classifier. For NER, word embeddings initialize a BiLSTM sequence labeler. By synergizing techniques, our hybrid approach achieves SOTA results on benchmark datasets, paving the way for more data-efficient and robust NLP systems.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology (IJISRT)"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956864.v1","title":["Supplementary Figure 4 from Early Changes in Tumor-Naive Cell-Free Methylomes and Fragmentomes Predict Outcomes in Pembrolizumab-Treated Solid Tumors"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1277-6335","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eric Y.","family":"Stutheit-Zhao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3119-3832","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Enrique","family":"Sanz-Garcia","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhihui (Amy)","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2607-5265","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Derek","family":"Wong","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2483-7166","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kayla","family":"Marsh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7657-9950","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Albiruni R.","family":"Abdul Razak","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3034-3042","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna","family":"Spreafico","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6771-2999","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Philippe L.","family":"Bedard","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2363-8707","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aaron R.","family":"Hansen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4405-5890","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephanie","family":"Lheureux","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9000-5803","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dax","family":"Torti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6437-6491","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bernard","family":"Lam","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-8412-2166","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shih Yu Cindy","family":"Yang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9522-8865","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Justin","family":"Burgener","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0039-747X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ping","family":"Luo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5719-1272","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yong","family":"Zeng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-9174-1099","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicholas","family":"Cheng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9946-6393","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Philip","family":"Awadalla","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8610-4908","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Scott V.","family":"Bratman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2915-9317","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pamela S.","family":"Ohashi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8073-5888","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Trevor J.","family":"Pugh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3500-0540","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lillian L.","family":"Siu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Validation of the 200 CpG signature using publicly available WGBS data.

The study further reveals that mortality is positively associated with aging populations in high-income countries and positively associated with obesity in upper-middle to high-income countries. Mortality is positively associated with healthcare expenditure, which likely reflects a country\u2019s preparedness and ability to better track, document, and report COVID-19 deaths.

Further analyses based on 2021 data reveal COVID-19 deaths are positively associated with the proportion of the population aged 65 and older in low to lower-middle-income countries, with obesity in high-income countries, and with tobacco use across most countries.

This order ranks in the top three in terms of predicted natural product diversity from available genomes, warranting further genome sequencing efforts. However, a major hurdle in obtaining the predicted products is that biosynthetic genes are often \u2018silent\u2019 or poorly expressed. Here we report complementary strain isolation, genomics, metabolomics, and synthetic biology approaches to enable natural product discovery. First, we built a collection of 316 rhizosphere-derived Burkholderiales strains over the course of five years. We then selected 115 strains for sequencing using the mass spectrometry pipeline IDBac to avoid strain redundancy. After predicting and comparing the biosynthetic potential of each strain, a biosynthetic gene cluster that was silent in the native Paraburkholderia megapolitana and Paraburkholderia acidicola producers was cloned and activated by heterologous expression in a Burkholderia sp. host, yielding megapolipeptins A and B. Megapolipeptins are unusual polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and polyunsaturated fatty acid hybrids that show low structural similarity to known natural products, highlighting the advantage of our Burkholderiales genomics-driven and synthetic biology-enabled pipeline to discover novel natural products.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0300256","title":["Antegrade anterior column acetabulum fracture fixation with cannulated compression headless screws\u2014A biomechanical study on standardized osteoporotic artificial bone"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9582-1810","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Till","family":"Berk","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ivan","family":"Zderic","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Peter","family":"Schwarzenberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Torsten","family":"Pastor","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ludmil","family":"Drenchev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hristo Kostov","family":"Skulev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7778-2480","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Geoff","family":"Richards","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-5009-2608","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Christian","family":"Hierholzer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1393-3232","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Sascha","family":"Halvachizadeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hans-Christoph","family":"Pape","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9795-115X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Boyko","family":"Gueorguiev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec id=\"sec001\">\n<jats:title>Purpose<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Due to the increase in life expectancy and high-energy traumas, anterior column acetabular fractures (ACFs) are also increasing.

In this study, we examine the transcriptional heterogeneity of cancer cells in human basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and identify a wound response-associated gene program as a prominent feature of invasive cancer cells. We find that invasive cancer cells are prevalent in ulcerated BCC tumors and exhibit a distinctive spatial organization. To explore the causal relationship between wounding and cancer progression, we compare tumors at baseline and one week after biopsy. Our results reveal that biopsy collection locally induces a transcriptional switch in cancer cells from an indolent to an invasive state. Notably, this progression is coupled with the reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts, which adopt a transcriptional state characteristic of therapy-resistant BCC.

While the downstream gene functions of EHMTs in adipogenic differentiation have been studied, their regulation and precise individual contributions remain elusive. We discovered the existence of a regulatory mechanism, wherein EHMT1 governs the interdependent expression of itself and the master regulator PPAR\u01b4 during the early phase of adipogenesis. In later stages, EHMT2 levels decline along with reduction in H3K9 dimethylation. Alteration of above sequence of events alone or in the presence of saturated-fatty acids lead to precocious induction of high levels of PPAR\u01b4, accelerated adipogenesis and hypertrophic adipocytes with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Countering the decrease in EHMTs effectively abrogated the inflammatory response of the adipocytes. Accordingly, induction of obesity by a high fat diet was sufficient to downregulate H3K9me2 levels and expression of EHMTs along with enhanced IL-6 generation.

The treatments were (1) control, basal diet; (2) YCW, basal diet + 1 g\/kg yeast cell wall; (3) YM1, basal diet + 0.5 g\/kg of a novel yeast mannan-rich product (YM); and (4) YM2, basal diet + 1 g\/kg YM. Growth performance was measured at 14, 28, and 35 days of age (d). At 26 and 27 d, nine birds per treatment were immunized intravenously with SRBCs, and antibody responses against SRBCs were analyzed through a hemagglutination assay 7 days post-inoculation. Supplementing YM tended to improve broiler chicken weight gain from 29 to 35 d (p = 0.053). An improvement in the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed in the birds fed YM diets during 29\u201335 d and over the entire experimental period (0\u201335 d; p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, birds fed YM2 diets had more robust antibody responses against SRBCs than the control birds (p = 0.033).

Attention is focused on the case when a uniform stream flows over a localised obstacle, although the solution is not restricted to this case. The inverse problem is formulated as a Stieltjes integral equation which is solved exactly using a Fourier transform. The solution requires the analytic continuation of two real functions representing the surface speed and the angle between the surface velocity vector and the horizontal. Some example surface profiles and their corresponding bottom topographies are discussed. Although the solution requires the prescription of the surface as a function of the velocity potential, it is shown to closely resemble the corresponding profile in physical space, even for quite large surface displacements, while significant discrepancy occurs at the bottom. Inference of the bottom profile from discrete surface data is accomplished by way of polynomial interpolation and rational approximation in the complex plane for the sample case of a hydraulic fall.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Water Waves"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956574","title":["Supplementary Table S5 from Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Following Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The PETAL Phase Ib Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3529-0103","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David J.","family":"Pinato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9164-3671","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonio","family":"D'Alessio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5654-9225","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Claudia Angela Maria","family":"Fulgenzi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5892-9224","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexandra Emilia","family":"Schlaak","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5662-2162","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ciro","family":"Celsa","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-8538-9251","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Saskia","family":"Killmer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7725-965X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jesus Miguens","family":"Blanco","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-3256-4515","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Caroline","family":"Ward","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8441-6470","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Charalampos-Vlasios","family":"Stikas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6973-3067","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mark R.","family":"Openshaw","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-7064-6601","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicole","family":"Acuti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9764-4288","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Georgios","family":"Nteliopoulos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7927-5538","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cristina","family":"Balcells","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7358-8851","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hector C.","family":"Keun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5184-4519","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert D.","family":"Goldin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2390-1886","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul J.","family":"Ross","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1209-5735","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alessio","family":"Cortellini","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-8373-0518","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Thomas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-9040-5646","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna-Mary","family":"Young","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5416-7971","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nathan","family":"Danckert","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-2783-8069","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul","family":"Tait","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7994-5239","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julian R.","family":"Marchesi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2552-740X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bertram","family":"Bengsch","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2441-549X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rohini","family":"Sharma","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Table 5.

Mutagenic photoproducts (CPDs, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6\u20104PPs, pyrimidine\u20106\u20104\u2010pyrimidone photoproducts) were formed in the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) by UVB (312\u2009nm) irradiation, and their concentrations were detected by HPLC\u2010MS\/MS as a function of time after the UVB treatment. RHE had been previously exposed or not (control) to blue light (427\u2009nm). Both CPDs and 6\u20104PPs were shown to last longer in blue\u2010light irradiated RHE, proving the inhibition of the DNA repair by blue light exposure. This is a highly relevant information because sunscreens allow people to enjoy longer periods under the sun and consequently, to endure very high doses of blue light. The work also reported results obtained with RHEs previously treated with a sunscreen formulation containing a broadband filter that offers blue\u2010light protection. Interestingly, authors observed that the DNA repair was not significantly inhibited in RHE previously treated with the sunscreen offering broadband protection.

Relatively few studies have examined multi-line reading, and fewer still Chinese multi-line reading. Here, we examined whether texts presented in single or double columns, and either left-justified or fully-justified affect Chinese reading. Text format had minimal influence on overall reading time; however, it significantly impacted return-sweeps (large saccades moving the eyes from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next). Return-sweeps were launched and landed further away from margins and involved more corrective saccades in single- than double-column format. For left- compared to fully-justified format, return-sweeps were launched and landed closer to margins. More corrective saccades also occurred. Our results showed more efficient return-sweep behavior for fully- than left-justified text. Moreover, there were clear trade-off effects such that formats requiring increased numbers of shorter return-sweeps produced more accurate targeting and reduced numbers of corrective fixations, whereas formats requiring reduced numbers of longer return-sweeps caused less accurate targeting and an increased rate of corrective fixations. Overall, our results demonstrate that text formats substantially affect return-sweep eye movement behavior during Chinese reading without affecting efficiency and effectiveness, that is, the overall time it takes to read and understand the text.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956292.v1","title":["Supplemental Figure 2 from GD2-Targeting CAR T-cell Therapy for Patients with GD2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt;

Additionally, <italic>REG3A<\/italic>mRNA and protein levels were elevated in TNBC tissues of locally treated patients, contrasting with low expression in adjacent normal tissues. In primary human TNBC cells REG3A shRNA notably hindered cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while triggering caspase-mediated apoptosis. Similarly, employing CRISPR-sgRNA for REG3A knockout showed significant anti-TNBC cell activity. Conversely, REG3A overexpression bolstered cell proliferation and migration. REG3A proved crucial for activating the Akt-mTOR cascade, as evidenced by decreased Akt-S6K1 phosphorylation upon REG3A silencing or knockout, which was reversed by REG3A overexpression. A constitutively active mutant S473D Akt1 (caAkt1) restored Akt-mTOR activation and counteracted the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induced by REG3A knockdown in breast cancer cells. Crucially, REG3A played a key role in maintaining mTOR complex integrity. Bioinformatics identified zinc finger protein 680 (ZNF680) as a potential REG3A transcription factor. Knocking down or knocking out ZNF680 reduced REG3A expression, while its overexpression increased it in primary breast cancer cells. Additionally, enhanced binding between ZNF680 protein and the REG3A promoter was observed in breast cancer tissues and cells. <italic>In vivo<\/italic>, REG3A shRNA significantly inhibited primary TNBC cell xenograft growth.

One mechanism of resistance to AR-targeting therapy is lineage plasticity, where the tumor undergoes a transformation to an AR-indifferent phenotype, most studied in the context of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). However, activation of additional de- or trans-differentiation programs, including a gastrointestinal (GI) gene expression program, has been suggested as an alternative method of resistance. In this study, we explored the previously identified GI prostate cancer phenotype (PCa-GI) in a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patient biopsy samples. Methods: We analyzed a dataset of 634 mCRPC samples with batch effect corrected gene expression data from the West Coast Dream Team (WCDT), the East Coast Dream Team (ECDT), the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and the Weill Cornell Medical center (WCM). Survival data was available from the WCDT and ECDT cohorts. We calculated a gene expression GI score using the sum of z-scores of genes from a published set of PCa-GI-defining genes (N=38). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression with endpoint overall survival from time of biopsy to death of any cause. Results: We found that the PCa-GI score had a bimodal distribution, identifying a distinct set of tumors with an activated GI expression pattern. Approximately 35% of samples were classified as PCa-GI high, which was concordant with prior reports. Liver metastases had the highest median score but after excluding liver samples, 29% of the remaining samples were still classified as PCa-GI high, suggesting a distinct phenotype not exclusive to liver metastases. No correlation was observed between GI score and proliferation, AR signaling, or NEPC scores. Furthermore, the PCa-GI score was not associated with genomic alterations in AR, FOXA1, RB1, TP53 or PTEN. However, tumors with MYC amplifications showed significantly higher GI scores (p=0.0001). Patients with PCa-GI tumors had a shorter survival (HR=1.5 [1.1-2.1], p=0.02), but this result was not significant after adjusting for the liver as metastatic site (HR=1.2 [0.82-1.7], p=0.35). Patients with PCa-GI low samples had a better outcome after androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ASI, abiraterone or enzalutamide) than other therapies (HR=0.37 [0.22-0.61], p=0.0001) while the benefit of ASI was smaller and non-significant for PCa-GI high samples (HR=0.55 [0.29-1.1], p=0.07). A differential pathway analysis identified FOXA2 signaling to be upregulated PCa-GI high tumors (FDR = 3.7 x 10-13). Conclusions: The PCa-GI phenotype is prevalent in clinical mCRPC samples and may represent a distinct biological entity. PCa-GI tumors may respond less to ASI and could offer a strategy to study novel therapeutic targets.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/polym16111588","title":["Comparison of Mechanical Property Simulations with Results of Limited Flexural Tests of Different Multi-Layer Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1551-2346","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ronald","family":"Bastovansky","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Design and Machine Elements, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of \u017dilina, Univerzitn\u00e1 8215\/1, 010 26 \u017dilina, Slovakia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6583-8128","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lukas","family":"Smetanka","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Design and Machine Elements, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of \u017dilina, Univerzitn\u00e1 8215\/1, 010 26 \u017dilina, Slovakia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7872-2829","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Kohar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Design and Machine Elements, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of \u017dilina, Univerzitn\u00e1 8215\/1, 010 26 \u017dilina, Slovakia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8505-4443","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rajesh Kumar","family":"Mishra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Material Science and Manufacturing Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamycka 129, 165 00 Prague, Czech Republic"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7643-8450","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michal","family":"Petru","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Machine Parts and Mechanism, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Liberec, Studentsk\u00e1 1402\/2, 461 17 Liberec, Czech Republic"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This article is focused on the experimental study of flexural properties in different multi-layer carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites and correlations with the results of finite element method (FEM) simulations of mechanical properties. The comparison of the results shows the possibility of reducing the number of experimental specimens for testing. The experimental study of flexural properties for four types of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites with twill weaves (2 \u00d7 2) was carried out. As input materials, pre-impregnated carbon laminate GG 204 T and GG 630 T (prepreg) and two types of carbon fiber fabrics (GG 285 T and GG 300 T (fabric)) were used. Multi-layer samples were manufactured from two types of prepregs and two types of fabrics, which were hand-impregnated during sample preparation. The layers were stacked using same orientation. All specimens for flexural test were cut with the longer side in the weft direction. Pre-impregnated carbon laminates were further impregnated with resin DT 121H. Carbon fabrics were hand-impregnated with epoxy matrix LG 120 and hardener HG 700. To fulfill the aim of this research, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations of mechanical properties were performed. The FEM simulations and analysis were conducted in Hexagon\u2019s MSC Marc Mentat 2022.3 and Digimat 2022.4 software. This paper presents the results of actual experimental bending tests and the results of simulations of bending tests for different composite materials (mentioned previously). We created material models for simulations based on two methods\u2014MF (Mean Field) and FE (Finite Element), and the comparative results show better agreement with the MF model. The composites (GG 285 T and GG 300 T) showed better flexural results than composites made from pre-impregnated carbon laminates (GG 204 T and GG 630 T). The difference in results for the hand-impregnated laminates was about 15% higher than for prepregs, but this is still within an acceptable tolerance as per the reported literature. The highest percentage difference of 14.25% between the simulation and the real experiment was found for the software tool Digimat FE 2022.4 \u2013 GG 630 T composite. The lowest difference of 0.5% was found for the software tool Digimat MF 2022.4 \u2013 GG 204 T composite. By comparing the results of the software tools with the results of the experimental measurements, it was found that the Digimat MF 2022.4 tool is closer to the results of the experimental measurements than the Digimat FE 2022.4 tool.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Polymers"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1186\/s12864-024-10476-y","title":["A comparative plastome approach enhances the assessment of genetic variation in the Melilotus genus"],"author":[{"given":"Pan","family":"Xu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Minghui","family":"Meng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fan","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jiyu","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p><jats:italic>Melilotus<\/jats:italic>, a member of the Fabaceae family, is a pivotal forage crop that is extensively cultivated in livestock regions globally due to its notable productivity and ability to withstand abiotic stress.

This concept is far more effective than the conventional access policies that are top down and cal beforehand for systematic risk avoidance; hence, it helps to minimize the chances of an organization being vulnerable to various risks by right management. Iturbide\u2019s data loss prevention technique eliminates the probability of losing sensitive information to the rest of the world as well as other unauthorized persons or organizations regaining access to privileged keys while Shamir\u2019s secret sharing algorithm- polynomial interpolation ensures that the generation of keys is not a time-consuming exercise. In order to address the issues of persistent security threats in cloud computing paradigm, the proposed model includes computation, encryption and access to improve the overall security of cloud environment.

RMC-6236 is a RAS(ON) multi-selective noncovalent inhibitor of the active, GTP-bound state of both mutant and wild-type variants of canonical RAS isoforms with broad therapeutic potential for the aforementioned unmet medical need. RMC-6236 exhibited potent anticancer activity across RAS-addicted cell lines, particularly those harboring mutations at codon 12 of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;\/i&gt;. Notably, oral administration of RMC-6236 was tolerated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;\/i&gt; and drove profound tumor regressions across multiple tumor types in a mouse clinical trial with &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12X&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/i&gt; xenograft models. Translational PK\/efficacy and PK\/PD modeling predicted that daily doses of 100 mg and 300 mg would achieve tumor control and objective responses, respectively, in patients with RAS-driven tumors. Consistent with this, we describe here objective responses in two patients (at 300 mg daily) with advanced &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;sup&gt;G12X&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/i&gt; lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively, demonstrating the initial activity of RMC-6236 in an ongoing phase I\/Ib clinical trial (NCT05379985).&lt;\/p&gt;Significance:&lt;p&gt;The discovery of RMC-6236 enables the first-ever therapeutic evaluation of targeted and concurrent inhibition of canonical mutant and wild-type RAS-GTP in RAS-driven cancers.

This review aims to summarize the evidence on the influence of CRF on overall and site-specific cancer risks. It delves into the biological mechanisms through which CRF may exert its effects, explores the clinical implications of these findings, identifies gaps in the current evidence base, and suggests directions for future research. The synthesis of findings reveals that higher CRF levels (general threshold of\u2009&gt;\u20097 METs) are consistently associated with a reduced risk of a range of cancers, including head and neck, lung, breast, gastrointestinal, particularly pancreatic and colorectal, bladder, overall cancer incidence and mortality, and potentially stomach and liver, bile duct, and gall bladder cancers. These inverse associations between CRF and cancer risk do not generally differ across age groups, sex, race, or adiposity, suggesting a universal protective effect of CRF. Nonetheless, evidence linking CRF with skin, mouth and pharynx, kidney, and endometrial cancers is limited and inconclusive. Conversely, higher CRF levels may be potentially linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer and hematological malignancies, such as leukemia and myeloma, although the evidence is still not conclusive. CRF appears to play a significant role in reducing the risk of several cancers through various biological mechanisms, including inflammation reduction, immune system enhancement, hormonal regulation, and metabolic improvements. Overall, enhancing CRF through regular physical activity offers a vital, accessible strategy for reducing cancer risk\u00a0and extending the health span. Future research should aim to fill the existing evidence gaps regarding specific cancers and elucidate the detailed dose\u2013response relationships between CRF levels and cancer risk.

Sleep should thus improve source memory. By comparing retention intervals filled with natural night sleep versus daytime wakefulness, we tested this prediction in two online source-monitoring experiments using intentionally learned pictures as items and incidentally learned screen positions and frame colors as source dimensions. In Experiment 1, we examined source memory by varying the spatial position of pictures on the computer screen. Multinomial modeling analyses revealed a significant sleep benefit in source memory. In Experiment 2, we manipulated both the spatial position and the frame color of pictures orthogonally to investigate source memory for two different source dimensions at the same time, also allowing exploration of bound memory for both source dimensions. The sleep benefit on spatial source memory replicated. In contrast, no source memory sleep benefit was observed for either frame color or bound memory of both source dimensions, probably as a consequence of a floor effect in incidental encoding of color associations. In sum, the results of both experiments show that sleep within a 12-h retention interval improves source memory for spatial positions, supporting the prediction of the active systems consolidation hypothesis. However, additional research is required to clarify the impact of sleep on source memory for other context features and bound memories of multiple source dimensions.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Memory &amp; Cognition"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/jsfa.13634","title":["Regulation of gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters in mice by <scp><i>Streptococcus thermophilus<\/i> GA8<\/scp>\u2010 and <scp><i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus<\/i> HAO9<\/scp>\u2010fermented milk containing high levels of gamma\u2010aminobutyric acid"],"author":[{"given":"Mei","family":"Han","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Food Science, Shanghai Business School  Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Yao","family":"Dong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Research and Development, Wecare Probiotics Co., Ltd  Suzhou China"}]},{"given":"Shuo","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"APC Microbiome Ireland  Cork Ireland"}]},{"given":"Xiaohui","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"APC Microbiome Ireland  Cork Ireland"}]},{"given":"Chen","family":"Bai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Food Science, Shanghai Business School  Shanghai China"}]},{"given":"Zhonghui","family":"Gai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Research and Development, Wecare Probiotics Co., Ltd  Suzhou China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>BACKGROUND<\/jats:title><jats:p>Gamma\u2010aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important neurotransmitter in the human body, with several negative emotions reported as being associated with GABA dysregulation.

We aimed to study potential variables involved in vitD deficiency among healthy Tunisian adults in order to establish two prediction algorithms: a composite algorithm (CA) that included genetic and non genetic factors and a simple one (SA) including only environmental non genetic factors. These algorithms could be used to predict vitD status and help identify individuals at high risk of vitD deficiency.\nMethods\n We screened six key genes (DBP, CYP2R1, CYP27B14, CYP24A1 and VDR) within the vitD metabolic pathway using 15 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in across a cohort of 394 unrelated healthy individuals. After giving an informed consent, all participants were asked to complete a generalized questionnaire. Significant confounding factors that may influence the variability in serum 25(OH)D levels were used as covariates for association analyses. Statistical study was carried out with SPSS26.0.\nResults\n VitD deficiency correlated positively with albumin (r\u2009=\u20090.135, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and negatively with serum PTH (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.303, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), age (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.198, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), and BMI (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.143, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that season, sun screen use, phototype, age, VDR- rs2228570 and CYP24A1- rs6013897 were significant predictors of hypovitaminosis D. Non genetic factors explained 15.6% of the variance in 25(OH)D concentrations while genetic polymorphisms (VDR- rs2228570 and CYP24A1- rs6013897) explained a lower variance of 12%. When combined together, genetic and non genetic factors contributed up to 27.6% in 25(OH)D concentrations variability.\nConclusion\n 25(OH)D deficiency is highly prevalent among healthy adults in Tunisia. It is related to seasonal fluctuations, increasing age, darker skin tones, excessive sunscreen usage, and genetic polymorphisms in the VDR and CYP24A1 genes. The genetic markers could be used as tools in Mendelian randomization analyses of vitD, and they should well be considered when establishing a supplementation protocol in order to prevent 25(OH)D deficiency in the Tunisian population.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/d16060329","title":["Macrobenthic Assemblages and the Influence of Microhabitat in a High-Mountain Lake (Northwest Italy)"],"author":[{"given":"Alice","family":"Gabetti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The Veterinary Medical Research Institute for Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d\u2019Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10154 Torino, Italy"},{"name":"Department of Life Sciences and System Biology, University of Turin, Via Accademia Albertina 13, 10123 Torino, Italy"}]},{"given":"Alessandra","family":"Maganza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Veterinary Medical Research Institute for Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d\u2019Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10154 Torino, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0001-1337-0591","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Camilla","family":"Mossotto","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Veterinary Medical Research Institute for Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d\u2019Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10154 Torino, Italy"}]},{"given":"Barbara","family":"Rizzioli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cottian Alps Protected Areas Management Authority, Via Fransu\u00e0 Fontan 1, 10050 Turin, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6665-2712","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Giuseppe","family":"Esposito","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The Veterinary Medical Research Institute for Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d\u2019Aosta, Via Bologna 148, 10154 Torino, Italy"}]},{"given":"Marco","family":"Bertoli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Via L.

These ecosystems host simplified biotic communities primarily concentrated in the littoral zone and dominated by benthic macroinvertebrates that serve as bioindicators of environmental pressures. A two-year monitoring investigation was performed in July 2022 and July 2023 at Nero Lake (Cesana Torinese, Northwest Italy). Five sites along the lakeshore were selected for sampling physicochemical water parameters and macrobenthos. All collected data were analysed to compare trends across years and within specific sites. The results revealed that Nero Lake exhibited consistent macrobenthic communities across the two years studied, but significant differences were observed in its microhabitats. This suggests that substrate type and physicochemical water parameters strongly influence community composition. Chironomidae larvae and Mollusca were the dominant species, showing distinct associations with different substrates and environmental factors from one year to another.

Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions.

Managers are in a unique position to address workplace mental health risk factors and implement changes that have a positive effect on the mental health and wellbeing of employees. However, many managers report a lack of knowledge and confidence in promoting workplace mental health, suggesting a need for formal training. Aims: We aimed to test the efficacy of a newly developed, digital mental health training intervention for managers, featured on Unmind \u2013 a workplace wellbeing platform that can be accessed via a mobile or web app. Methods: We conducted a web-based, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Participants were digitally-engaged managers in desk-based roles, residing in the US or UK, who were randomized to the intervention or a no-intervention control group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome was manager confidence to create mentally healthy workplaces, whilst secondary outcomes included manager knowledge, behavior, mental health stigma, and compassion for self and others. Outcomes were captured at baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1) and 3-month follow-up (t2), and analyzed using mixed effects models with intention-to-treat principles.  Results: 300 participants were randomized, and 91.7% were retained at t2. 55.7% of managers randomized to the training completed all sessions. All outcomes showed significantly larger improvement in the intervention group compared to control at t1 and t2, except for self-compassion at t1 and mental health stigma which was marginal at both timepoints. The between-group Hedges\u2019 g effect size for manager confidence was 0.38 [0.15 \u2013 0.61] at t1 (the primary endpoint) and 0.48 [0.25 \u2013 0.71] at t2. Conclusions: These findings show that a brief, digital training intervention can improve manager knowledge and confidence, leading to positive changes in manager behavior. Given the accessibility of such interventions, this could have major implications for mitigating the human and financial impact of poor mental health in the workplace.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.05.31.596809","title":["Stick-slip unfolding favors self-association of expanded HTT mRNA"],"author":[{"given":"Brett M","family":"O'Brien","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Roumita","family":"Moulick","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gabriel","family":"Jimenez Avalos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nandakumar","family":"Rajasekaran","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Christian M","family":"Kaiser","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0170-1987","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sarah","family":"Woodson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In Huntington's Disease (HD) and related disorders, expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats produces a toxic gain of function in affected neurons.

The physical basis of RNA aggregation has been difficult to disentangle owing to the heterogeneous structure of the CAG repeats. Here, we probe the folding and unfolding pathways of expHTT mRNA using single-molecule force spectroscopy. Whereas normal HTT mRNAs unfold reversibly and cooperatively, expHTT mRNAs with 20 or 40 CAG repeats slip and unravel non-cooperatively at low tension. Slippage of CAG base pairs is punctuated by concerted rearrangement of adjacent CCG trinucleotides, trapping partially folded structures that readily base pair with another RNA strand. We suggest that the conformational entropy of the CAG repeats, combined with stable CCG base pairs, creates a stick-slip behavior that explains the aggregation propensity of expHTT mRNA.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.26508\/lsa.202402784","title":["Crosstalk between Regnase-1 and -3 shapes mast cell survival and cytokine expression"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8525-6309","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marian","family":"Bataclan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05gfswd81","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine","place":[", Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland"]}]},{"given":"Cristina","family":"Leoni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05gfswd81","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine","place":[", Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland"]}]},{"given":"Simone G","family":"Moro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05gfswd81","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine","place":[", Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland"]}]},{"given":"Matteo","family":"Pecoraro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05gfswd81","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine","place":[", Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland"]}]},{"given":"Elaine H","family":"Wong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Immunology, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in Munich, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany"}]},{"given":"Vigo","family":"Heissmeyer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Immunology, Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in Munich, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany"},{"name":"Research Unit Molecular Immune Regulation, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5909-8802","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Silvia","family":"Monticelli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/05gfswd81","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"Institute for Research in Biomedicine","place":[", Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland"]}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Post-transcriptional regulation of immune-related transcripts by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) impacts immune cell responses, including mast cell functionality.

Circular water economy, meaning reuse and recycling of water, and recovering resources can help reducing emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. Several actions are possible including reusing reverse osmosis reject water, employable for gardening, aquaponics or even simply for toilet flushing, or in sterilization settings, reusing spent dialysate, at least for toilet flushing, but with wider use if microbiologically purified, recovering thermal energy from spent dialysate, that can probably be done with simple devices, or using phosphate-rich spent dialysate for producing fertilizers, namely struvite. All these options may be economically sound, and all help reducing the final dialysis carbon footprint.

They serve as drivers of epigenetic regulation; therefore, individual characteristics of the distribution of retroelements in the genome influence the development of multifactorial diseases. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial disease with an immune response against pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The role of heredity in the development of the disease is estimated at 88%, and the role of allelic variants of various genes is determined. There are also other specific types of diabetes mellitus, which account for more than 2% of cases of diabetes mellitus and are monogenic diseases with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance due to germline mutations in the MODY genes, including HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B. Most patients with type 1 diabetes have the protein product and ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the insulin inhibitor HERV-W-Env, which is caused by abnormal expression of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV). An assumption has been made about the role of retroelements in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is due to their involvement in the phylogenetic formation of the endocrine system, since in evolution retroelements turned out to be sources of regulatory sequences of hormone genes, nuclear hormone receptors and binding sites for them. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with the integration of HERV into the HLA-DQ gene region, with allelic variants and sizes of VNTR variable tandem repeats (part of the SVA retroelements), which regulate the expression of the insulin gene and other hormones. For this reason, it is likely that the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus may be based on individual characteristics of the distribution of HERVs in the human genome and their dynamic changes in ontogenesis. HERVs also play a role in the etiopathogenesis of diabetes mellitus through the activation of an autoimmune response, the triggering factors of which are exogenous viral infections and stress. Thus, retroelements are involved in various mechanisms of the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which reflects their global regulatory influence on endocrine regulation.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Kazan medical journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956655","title":["Supplementary Figure S13 from Safety and

The European Union\u2019s Circular Economy Action Plan is a significant initiative in this direction. Biotechnological processes, especially the valorisation of agri-food waste to produce highly marketed biomolecules like poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) using microorganisms as cellular factories, offer promising avenues for achieving these goals. PHBV is a biodegradable polymer firstly characterised as an isolated biopolymer from bacterial biomass. This biopolymer shows interesting physicochemical properties making possible immense potential in various applications due to its biocompatibility and sustainability, thus revealing it as a good candidate to replace plastics produced by chemical synthesis from petroleum (which are highly recalcitrant and consequently pollutants).

However, the data acquisition time to estimate thresholds (for both ears across four audiometric frequencies) using this method usually exceeds the sleep time (ranging between 35 and 49 minutes) in infants below 4 months, thus providing incomplete information of hearing status which in turn delays timely clinical intervention. Alternate approaches using faster rate, or tone-burst trains have not been readily accepted due to additional hardware and software requirements. We propose here a novel binaural multifrequency stimulation paradigm wherein several stimuli of different frequencies are presented binaurally in an interleaved manner. The rationale here is that the proposed paradigm will increase acquisition efficiency, significantly reduce test time, and improve accuracy by incorporating an automatic wave V detection algorithm.

Its implementation requires the coordination of low-level control tasks with high-level supervision and planning. The use of the PID-based manipulation control addresses only the dynamical response and requires the use of optimization-based techniques at the supervisory level. On the contrary, model predictive control (MPC) simplifies the design as it combines both tasks within a single algorithm. However, successful MPC implementation depends on the quality of the internal model utilized by the algorithm. Robots are intrinsically and significantly nonlinear control objects, so their models are inherently complex. This leads to computational problems. Standard solutions are to shorten the MPC horizons or to parallelize calculations. The approach suggested here returns to the problem roots, i.e. to the model. This study proposes simplified models that allow the use of the MPC. General Hammerstein\u2013Wiener-like model is applied to an arm, which is further simplified into the linear dynamics used as the predictive supervisory control over the torque control. The head uses linear dynamics used by the supervisory MPC working with the base servomotors. It is shown that they are computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate. It is shown that the linear MPC controllers, which use the suggested simplified dynamic robot models, can successfully support visual servoing with accurate control. They are compared with standard PID-based structures and show their superiority. The proposed approach is successfully validated using Matlab and Gazebo robot simulator and is ultimately confirmed by experiments on a real robot.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nonlinear Dynamics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1111\/eulj.12507","title":["Does the European Union's rule of law require the criminalisation of EU public officials?

Human FUS fibril-induced FUS aggregation in the mouse brain of humanized FUS mice is accelerated by an ALS-causing FUS mutant relative to wild-type human FUS.

Fibril-induced human FUS aggregates recapitulate pathological features of FTLD including increased detergent insolubility of FUS and TAF15 and amyloid-like, cytoplasmic deposits of FUS that accumulate ubiquitin and p62, but not TDP-43. Finally, injection of sonicated FUS fibrils is shown to exacerbate age-dependent cognitive and behavioral deficits from mutant human FUS expression.

The mid-century period is widely regarded as a critical moment, during which adaptation is deemed essential to mitigating the associated impacts. This study presents future climate projections across Tanzania using the latest generation of global climate models (CMIP6) combined with a high-resolution regional climate model. The findings indicate that, the trends in temperature and precipitation in Tanzania from 1991 to 2020, minimum temperatures showed the highest variability with a trend of 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C, indicating significant fluctuations in minimum temperature over the decades. Maximum temperatures also showed high variability with a trend of 0.4\u00a0\u00b0C. There is a range of variability in precipitation per decade for different regions in Tanzania, with some regions experiencing significant decreases in precipitation of up to\u2009\u2212\u200990.3\u00a0mm and\u2009\u2212\u2009127.6\u00a0mm. However, there were also regions that experienced increases in precipitation, although these increases were generally less than 4.8\u00a0mm over the decades. The projections of minimum and maximum temperatures from 2040 to 2071 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2\u20134.5 and SSP 5\u20138.5 are projected to increase by 0.14\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.21\u00a0\u00b0C per decade, across different regions. The average projected precipitation changes per decade vary across regions. Some regions are projected to experience increases in precipitation. Other regions are projected to show decreases in precipitation within the range of\u2009\u2212\u20090.6\u00a0mm to 15.5\u00a0mm and\u2009\u2212\u20091.5\u00a0mm to 47.4\u00a0mm under SSP2\u20134.5 and SSP5\u20138.5 respectively. Overall, both scenarios show an increase in projected temperatures and precipitation for most regions in Tanzania, with some areas experiencing more significant increases compared to others. The changes in temperatures and precipitation are expected to have significant impacts on agriculture and water resources in Tanzania.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Scientific Reports"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/stmcls\/sxae040","title":["Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor secretion and immunosuppression are distinct potency mechanisms of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells"],"author":[{"given":"Tyler U","family":"Faircloth","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]},{"given":"Sara","family":"Temple","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]},{"given":"Rhett N","family":"Parr","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]},{"given":"Anna Bryce","family":"Tucker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]},{"given":"Devi","family":"Rajan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]},{"given":"Peiman","family":"Hematti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee , WI 53226, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8686-4189","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Subra","family":"Kugathasan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine & Children's Healthcare of Atlanta , Atlanta, GA, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1877-8975","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Raghavan","family":"Chinnadurai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Savannah , GA 31324, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are investigated as cellular therapeutics for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and associated Perianal Fistula, although consistent efficacy remains a concern. Determining host factors that modulate MSCs\u2019 potency including their secretion of angiogenic &amp; wound healing factors, immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory properties are important determinants of their functionality. We investigated the mechanisms that regulate the secretion of angiogenic &amp; wound healing factors and immune suppression of human bone marrow MSCs. Secretory analysis of MSCs focusing on eighteen angiogenic &amp; wound healing secretory molecules identified the most abundancy of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A(VEGF-A). MSC viability and secretion of other angiogenic factors are not dependent on VEGF-A secretion which exclude the autocrine role of VEGF-A on MSC\u2019s fitness. However, combination of inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3and TNF\u03b1reduces MSC\u2019s VEGF-A secretion. To identify the effect of intestinal microvasculature on MSCs\u2019 potency, coculture analysis was performed between Human Large Intestine Microvascular Endothelial Cells(HLMVECs) and human bone marrow derived MSCs. HLMVECs do not attenuate MSCs\u2019 viability despite blocking their VEGF-A secretion. In addition, HLMVECs neither attenuate MSC\u2019s IFN\u03b3mediated upregulation of immunosuppressive enzyme Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase(IDO) nor abrogate suppression of T cell proliferation despite the attenuation of VEGF-A secretion. We found that HLMVECs express copious amounts of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and mechanistic analysis showed that pharmacological blocking reverses HLMVEC mediated attenuation of MSC\u2019s VEGF-A secretion. Together these results suggest that secretion of VEGF-A and immunosuppression are separable functions of MSCs which are regulated by distinct mechanisms in the host.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Stem Cells"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1088\/1402-4896\/ad4f2e","title":["Impact of media information and reinfection in a COVID-19 dynamical model: emergence of periodic orbits through Hopf bifurcation"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4948-6342","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Arpita","family":"Devi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0889-9802","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Praveen Kumar","family":"Gupta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In the current study, we investigate an SIRI compartmental model of COVID-19 incorporating the effect of social media and TV advertisements on the disease transmission of COVID-19 in the presence of reinfection.

Beyond the physical dimensions of disease, psoriasis has an extensive emotional and psychosocial effect on patients, affecting social functioning and interpersonal relationships. As a disease of systemic inflammation, psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and malignancy. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and a skin biopsy is seldom required. Depending on the severity of disease, appropriate treatment can be initiated. For mild to moderate disease, first-line treatment involves topical therapies including corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues, and combination products. These topical treatments are efficacious and can be safely initiated and prescribed by primary care physicians. Patients with more severe and refractory symptoms might require further evaluation by a dermatologist for systemic therapy .Psoriasis is a chronic, noncommunicable, painful, disfiguring and disabling disease for which there is no\u00a0 cure and with great negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life . It can occur at any age. The etiology of psoriasis remains unclear.\u00a0 Psoriasis can also be provoked by external and internal triggers, including mild trauma,\u00a0 sunburn, infections, systemic drugs and stress . Psoriasis involves the skin and nails, and is associated with a number of comorbidities. Skin lesions are\u00a0 localized or generalized, mostly symmetrical, sharply demarcated, red papules and plaques, and usually\u00a0 covered with white or silver scales. Lesions cause itching, stinging and pain. Individuals with psoriasis are reported to be at increased risk of developing other\u00a0 serious clinical conditions such as cardiovascular and other noncommunicable diseases .

Their health impacts include endocrine disruption, cancer, reproductive effects, and neurobehavioral and developmental disorders in children. Emerging literature suggests that legacy POP-BFRs are increasingly found in consumer products, including those used for and by children. The presence of legacy POP-BFRs in children\u2019s products is a big concern. Children are more vulnerable to chemical exposure risks than adults because their bodies are still developing and fragile. The rising problem is contributed to by the global push towards a circular economy that encourages responsible production and consumption by practising the recycling of waste materials. Waste materials such as electronic and electrical equipment plastics often contain POP-BFRs. POP-BFRs in waste materials are transferred into new products through recycling. The recycled products have become a potential source of exposure to legacy POP-BFRs for vulnerable populations, particularly children. Our scoping review aims to map and summarise the emerging literature.

However, the computational and storage resources of the core processing equipment of weeding robots are limited. Aiming at the current problems of high computation and the high number of model parameters in weeding robots, this paper proposes a lightweight weed target detection model based on the improved YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8), called RVDR-YOLOv8 (Reversible Column Dilation-wise Residual). First, the backbone network is reconstructed based on RevCol (Reversible Column Networks). The unique reversible columnar structure of the new backbone network not only reduces the computational volume but also improves the model generalisation ability. Second, the C2fDWR module is designed using Dilation-wise Residual and integrated with the reconstructed backbone network, which improves the adaptive ability of the new backbone network RVDR and enhances the model\u2019s recognition accuracy for occluded targets. Again, GSConv is introduced at the neck end instead of traditional convolution to reduce the complexity of computation and network structure while ensuring the model recognition accuracy. Finally, InnerMPDIoU is designed by combining MPDIoU with InnerIoU to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the computational complexity of the new model is reduced by 35.8%, the number of parameters is reduced by 35.4% and the model size is reduced by 30.2%, while the mAP50 and mAP50-95 values are improved by 1.7% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to YOLOv8. The overall performance of the new model is improved compared to models such as Faster R-CNN, SSD and RetinaNet.

The resting electrocardiogram showed a very fast ventricular response, and the echocardiography showed a depressed left ventricular function, raising the suspicion of a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. Since the patient was on maximum doses of atrioventricular nodal-blocking drugs, we opted for a physiological pacing and atrioventricular node ablation strategy. First, the His bundle capture was achieved at low pacing thresholds, and ablation of the atrioventricular node was attempted. Unfortunately, after several failed attempts, an acute increase in the His bundle capture threshold was noted, suggesting inadvertent tissue ablation beneath the pacing lead. In this scenario, we removed the lead from the His bundle area and achieved optimal left bundle branch area pacing. With the lead in this position, atrioventricular node ablation was performed during the first attempt. At the six-month follow-up, there was no recovery of atrioventricular node conduction. Device interrogation revealed stable pacing and sensing parameters, and there was a significant improvement in clinical status and left ventricular function.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Mastering both His bundle pacing and left bundle branch area pacing offers the potential to overcome intraprocedural challenges, giving alternative strategies to achieve physiological pacing.

Here, we present AFMfit, a flexible fitting procedure that deforms an input atomic model to match multiple AFM observations. The fitted models form a conformational ensemble that unambiguously describes the AFM experiment. Our method uses a new fast fitting algorithm based on the nonlinear Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) method NOLB to associate each molecule with its conformational state. AFMfit processes conformations of hundreds of AFM images of a single molecule in a few minutes on a single workstation, enabling analysis of larger datasets, including high-speed (HS)-AFM.

A number of solutions are being explored that could enable a more sustainable plastics system. So far, most research has focused on isolated technical solutions that address only one specific sustainability challenge posed by plastics, such as end-of-life management or feedstock alternatives to fossil fuels. Some interventions might mitigate one problem but contribute to another at a different stage of the plastics life cycle. This study is based on a literature review and adopts qualitative system dynamics to analyse the unsustainability of plastics with a holistic, integrative approach. The review shows that there is still no agreed definition of sustainable plastics, so the authors propose one based on inputs from the literature. The paper provides an overview of the impacts of potential solutions on the plastics system, highlighting how some interventions could end up having unintended consequences, perhaps even overshadowing the benefits.

immunotherapy is approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) that are transplant ineligible (TI) and is considered the best standard of care (SOC). To improve current SOC, we evaluated the added value of weekly bortezomib (V) to isatuximab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IsaRd versus Isa-VRd). This Intergroupe Francophone of Myeloma phase 3 study randomized 270 patients with NDMM that were TI, aged 65\u201379\u2009years, to IsaRd versus Isa-VRd arms. The primary endpoint was a minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate at 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> by next-generation sequencing at 18\u2009months from randomization. Key secondary endpoints included response rates, MRD assessment rates, survival and safety. The 18-month MRD negativity rates at 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> were reported in 35 patients (26%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19\u201334) in IsaRd versus 71 (53%, 95% CI 44\u201361) in Isa-VRd (odds ratio for MRD negativity 3.16, 95% CI 1.89\u20135.28, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). The MRD benefit was consistent across subgroups at 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> and 10<jats:sup>\u22126<\/jats:sup>, and was already observed at month 12. The proportion of patients with complete response or better at 18\u2009months was higher with Isa-VRd (58% versus 33%; <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001), as was the proportion of MRD negativity and complete response or better (37% versus 17%; <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.0003). At a median follow-up of 23.5\u2009months, no difference was observed for survival times (immature data). The addition of weekly bortezomib did not significantly affect the relative dose intensity of IsaRd. Isa-VRd significantly increased MRD endpoints, including the 18-month negativity rate at 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup>, the primary endpoint, compared with IsaRd. This study proposes Isa-VRd as a new SOC for patients with NDMM that are TI.

Despite the initially high sensitivity rate to anticancer therapies, a large number of patients develop resistance, leading to a poor prognosis. The mechanisms related to drug resistance are highly complex, and long non-coding RNAs appear to play a crucial role in these processes. Among these, the lncRNA homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), widely implicated in cancer initiation and progression, likewise plays a significant role in anticancer drug resistance. It can modulate cell activities such as proliferation, apoptosis, hypoxia, autophagy, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to the development of resistant tumour cells. In this manuscript, we describe different mechanisms of antitumor drug resistance in which HOTAIR is involved and suggest its potential as a therapeutic predictive biomarker for the management of

Laparoscopic repair and open repair with mesh are the typical treatments for inguinal hernia, and both regimens have proved beneficial in treating inguinal hernia. However, recurrence, with a rate as high as 33, poses a significant problem to the effective treatment of inguinal hernia.\nThe aim: This study aims to show about laparascopic versus open mesh repair for recurrent inguinal hernia. \nMethods: By comparing itself to the standards set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020, this study was able to show that it met all of the requirements. So, the experts were able to make sure that the study was as up-to-date as it was possible to be. For this search approach, publications that came out between 2013 and 2023 were taken into account. Several different online reference sources, like Pubmed and SagePub, were used to do this. It was decided not to take into account review pieces, works that had already been published, or works that were only half done. \nResult: In the PubMed database, the results of our search brought up 10 articles, whereas the results of our search on SagePub brought up 60 articles. The results of the search conducted for the last year of 2013 yielded a total 2 articles for PubMed and 14 articles for SagePub. The result from title screening, a total 1 articles for PubMed and 10 articles for SagePub. In the end, we compiled a total of 7 papers. We included five research that met the criteria. \nConclusion: The laparoscopic approach is superior to the open mesh approach for the repair of recurrent inguinal hernia in some aspects, including the incision infection rate and length of hospital stay. However, more high-quality studies on the effects of laparoscopic and open mesh repair for the treatment of recurrent inguinal hernia are warranted.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Advanced Research in Medical and Health Science (ISSN 2208-2425)"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/advs.202309003","title":["Quasi\u2010Homoepitaxial Growth of Highly Strained Alkali\u2010Metal Ultrathin Films on Kagome Superconductors"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4396-8292","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Takemi","family":"Kato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics Graduate School of Science Tohoku University  Sendai 980\u20138578 Japan"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2462-2253","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kosuke","family":"Nakayama","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics Graduate School of Science Tohoku University  Sendai 980\u20138578 Japan"}]},{"given":"Yongkai","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Quantum Physics Key Laboratory of Advanced Optoelectronic Quantum Architecture and Measurement (MOE) School of Physics Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing 100081 P.

Therefore, while homoepitaxy, the growth of thin film on a substrate made of the same material, is a useful method to fabricate high\u2010quality thin films, its application to studying strain\u2010induced structural phases is limited. Contrary to this general belief, here the quasi\u2010homoepitaxial growth of Cs and Rb thin films is reported with substantial in\u2010plane compressive strain.

These findings provide a useful approach for synthesizing highly strained thin films by quasi\u2010homoepitaxy, and pave the way for investigating many\u2010body interactions in Fermi liquids with tunable dimensionality.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Advanced Science"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1186\/s12879-024-09455-1","title":["Temporal composition of the cervicovaginal microbiome associates with hrHPV infection outcomes in a longitudinal study"],"author":[{"given":"Mariano A.","family":"Molina","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"William P.

Quantitative studies of variation in these territory features can generate deeper insights into animal ecology and behavior. We explored the effect of age, breeding strategy, population density, and number of neighbors on the size and shape of breeding territories in an island population of Passerculus sandwichensis (Savannah Sparrow). Our dataset consisted of 407 breeding territories belonging to 225 males sampled over 11 years. We compared territory sizes to the age of the male territorial holder, the male\u2019s reproductive strategy (monogamy vs. polygyny), the number of birds in the study population (population density), and the number of immediate territorial neighbors (local density). We found substantial variation in territory size, with territories ranging over two orders of magnitude from 57 to 5727 m2 (0.0057\u20130.57 ha). Older males had larger territories, polygynous males had larger territories, territories were smaller in years with higher population density, and larger territories were associated with more immediate territorial neighbors. We also found substantial variation in territory shape, from near-circular to irregularly-shaped territories. Males with more neighbors had irregularly shaped territories, but shape did not vary with male age, breeding strategy, or population density. For males that lived two years or longer, we found strong consistent individual differences in territory size across years, but weaker individual differences in territory shape, suggesting that size has high repeatability whereas shape has low repeatability. Our work provides evidence that songbird territories are highly dynamic, and that their size and shape reflect both intrinsic factors (age and number of breeding partners) and extrinsic factors (population density and number of territorial neighbors).<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Ornithology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2024.1341556","title":["Examining the association of family environment and children emotional\/behavioral difficulties in the relationship between parental anxiety and internet addiction in youth"],"author":[{"given":"Yuxin","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Keyin","family":"Zhou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yang","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jing","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yuanchen","family":"Xie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xin","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenyi","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiyan","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jie","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fei","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction<\/jats:title><jats:p>Associations between parental anxiety and adolescent internet addiction have been documented in the literature; however, few studies have analyzed the role of the family environment in this relationship.

A survey experiment with 314 visitors to the national park compares the influence of a narrative portraying the regulation's target group as a hero (a park visitor) on policy opinion and a narrative portraying another hero (a firefighter). Results show that the audience\u2010as\u2010hero narrative has more influence on policy support than a nonnarrative message and also more than a narrative portraying another hero.

While graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely adopted for this task, existing GCN-based methods still face challenges. Firstly, they employ fixed receptive fields, failing to account for urban region heterogeneity where different functional zones interact distinctly with their surroundings. Secondly, they lack mechanisms to adaptively adjust spatial receptive fields based on temporal dynamics, which limits prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Receptive Field Graph Convolutional Network (ARFGCN) for urban crowd flow prediction. ARFGCN allows each region to independently determine its receptive field size, adaptively adjusted and learned in an end-to-end manner during training, enhancing model prediction performance. It comprises a time-aware adaptive receptive field (TARF) gating mechanism, a stacked 3DGCN, and a prediction layer. The TARF aims to leverage gating in neural networks to adapt receptive fields based on temporal dynamics, enabling the predictive network to adapt to urban regional heterogeneity. The TARF can be easily integrated into the stacked 3DGCN, enhancing the prediction.

More research is needed to find out more about why spending time with other autistic people helps some autistic people. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Autism"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.c.7265797.v1","title":["Data from Preclinical Efficacy of a PSMA-Targeted Actinium-225 Conjugate (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;\/sup&gt;Ac-Macropa-Pelgifatamab): A Targeted Alpha Therapy for Prostate Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8028-2631","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christoph A.","family":"Schatz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1476-6299","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sabine","family":"Zitzmann-Kolbe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-6067-2864","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ingrid","family":"Moen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-9050-6158","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Monika","family":"Klotz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2221-1987","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shankari","family":"Nair","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-0341-6923","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stefan","family":"Stargard","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-0678-5517","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Roger M.","family":"Bjerke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-6471-8453","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Katrine","family":"Wickstr\u00f8m Biseth","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-7549-1555","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuan Zeng","family":"Feng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4347-9958","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"B\u00e5rd","family":"Indrevoll","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-1043-7021","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Veronique","family":"Cruciani","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5119-3274","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jenny","family":"Karlsson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4490-0663","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bernard","family":"Haendler","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-6632-7835","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Carsten H.","family":"Nielsen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-2487-8837","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maria Z.","family":"Alfsen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5635-9878","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stefanie","family":"Hammer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-8546-5537","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hartwig","family":"Hennekes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-4887-9761","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alan","family":"Cuthbertson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-6509-0844","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Urs B.","family":"Hagemann","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0008-9375-5715","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"\u00c5smund","family":"Larsen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;div&gt;AbstractPurpose:&lt;p&gt;Initially, prostate cancer responds to hormone therapy, but eventually resistance develops. Beta emitter-based prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radionuclide therapy is approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here we introduce a targeted alpha therapy (TAT) consisting of the PSMA antibody pelgifatamab covalently linked to a macropa chelator and labeled with actinium-225 and compare its efficacy and tolerability with other TATs.&lt;\/p&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;\/i&gt; characteristics and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;\/i&gt; biodistribution, antitumor efficacy, and tolerability of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;\/sup&gt;Ac-macropa-pelgifatamab (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;\/sup&gt;Ac-pelgi) and other TATs were investigated in cell line\u2013 and patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft models. The antitumor efficacy of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;\/sup&gt;Ac-pelgi was also investigated in combination with the androgen receptor inhibitor darolutamide.&lt;\/p&gt;Results:&lt;p&gt;Actinium-225-labeling of &lt;sup&gt;225&lt;\/sup&gt;Ac-pelgi was efficient already at room temperature. Potent &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;\/i&gt; cytotoxicity was seen in PSMA-expressing (LNCaP, MDA-PCa-2b, and C4-2) but not in PSMA-negative (PC-3 and DU-145) cell lines.

It can be ordered by pediatricians, nephrologists, emergency room pediatricians and urologists.

Indicators (age of the patient, gender, referring specialist \u2013 urologist or nephrologists and indications for voiding cystourethrography) were analyzed using Chi-square, Fisher\u2019s exact and Mann-Whitney test. Possible impact of the above mentioned indicators on the result of the voiding cystourethrography was analyzed using logistic regressive analysis.\n<bold>Results<\/bold>: Total of 197 voiding cystourethrographies were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U test did not show statistically significant age difference between the patients with normal (median age 3 years) and pathologic (median age 2.5 years) findings on voiding cystourethrography (Z=-0.415, p=0.678). Chi-square test showed that patients with single urinary infection and other indications have a higher chance of normal result on voiding cystourethrography (0.041 and 0.011 respectively). Logistic regressive analysis showed that patients whose referring specialist was\nurologist had 2.06 times higher chance for having pathologic finding on voiding cystourethrography (b=-0.810, p=0.007, odds ratio=0.445) compared to those referred by nephrologists.\n<bold>Conclusions<\/bold>: It is used as the \u201cgold standard\u201d radiographic test to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux. It is however associated by necessary radiation exposure. At our Institute pediatric urologists indicate voiding cystourethrography more cautiously compared to pediatric nephrologists. By avoiding voiding cystourethrography after single urinary tract infection and for other indications we could reduce the number of voiding cystourethrographies performed.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1177\/10780874241259425","title":["Transforming a Day-Laborer's Quarter into a Service Hub: An Analysis of the Case of Kotobuki in Yokohama, Japan, Using Public Choice and Neo-Hegelian Theories"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7611-9292","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hiroshi","family":"Ito","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Graduate School of Management, Nagoya University of Business and Commerce, Nagoya, Japan"}]},{"given":"Chisato","family":"Igano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Global Communication, J.

This study aims to avoid the laborious task of annotation by achieving unsupervised underwater object detection through domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD). In DAOD, there exists a conflict between feature transferability and discriminability, suppressing the detection performance. To address this challenge, a domain collaborative bridging detector (DCBD) including intra-domain consistency constraint (IDCC) and domain collaborative bridging (DCB), is proposed. On one hand, previous static domain labels in adversarial-based methods hinder the domain discriminator from discerning subtle intra-domain discrepancies, thus decreasing feature transferability. IDCC addresses this by introducing contrastive learning to refine intra-domain similarity. On the other hand, DAOD encourages the feature extractor to extract domain-invariant features, overlooking potential discriminative signals embedded within domain attributes.

The feasibility of DCBD is validated using unlabeled underwater shipwrecks as a case study.

To address the peculiarities of software engineering texts, sentiment analysis tools often consider the specific technical lingo practitioners use. To further improve the application of sentiment analysis, there have been two recommendations: Using pre-trained transformer models to classify sentiment and replacing non-natural language elements with meta-tokens. In this work, we benchmark five different sentiment analysis tools (two pre-trained transformer models and three machine learning tools) on 2 gold-standard sentiment analysis datasets. We find that pre-trained transformers outperform the best machine learning tool on only one of the two datasets, and that even on that dataset the performance difference is a few percentage points. Therefore, we recommend that software engineering researchers should not just consider predictive performance when selecting a sentiment analysis tool because the best-performing sentiment analysis tools perform very similarly to each other (within 4 percentage points). Meanwhile, we find that meta-tokenization does not improve the predictive performance of sentiment analysis tools. Both of our findings can be used by software engineering researchers who seek to apply sentiment analysis tools to software engineering data.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Empirical Software Engineering"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956821.v1","title":["Table S15 from Deep-Learning Model for Tumor-Type Prediction Using Targeted Clinical Genomic Sequencing Data"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0740-7431","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Madison","family":"Darmofal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9144-1527","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shalabh","family":"Suman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2817-3117","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gurnit","family":"Atwal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8206-6414","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael","family":"Toomey","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4036-6969","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jie-Fu","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1705-1870","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jason C.","family":"Chang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0227-3523","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Efsevia","family":"Vakiani","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5426-0885","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna M.","family":"Varghese","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6104-5665","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anoop","family":"Balakrishnan Rema","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-8702-7984","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aijazuddin","family":"Syed","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0131-4904","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nikolaus","family":"Schultz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3882-5000","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael F.","family":"Berger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2760-6999","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Quaid","family":"Morris","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Shapley values significantly associated with cancer types.

The development of this tumour is associated with several genetic disorders, many of which are still unknown. One type of RNA molecules currently being intensively studied in many types of cancer are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNA-coding genes occupy a large fraction of the human genome. LncRNAs regulate many aspects of cell development, metabolism, and other physiological processes. Diverse types of lncRNA can function as a tumour suppressor or an oncogene that can alter migration, invasion, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune system response. Recent studies suggest that selected lncRNAs are important in an endometrial cancer course. Our article describes over 70 lncRNAs involved in the development of endometrial cancer, which were studied via in vivo and in vitro research. It was proved that lncRNAs could both promote and inhibit the development of endometrial cancer. In the future, lncRNAs may become an important therapeutic target. The aim of this study is to review the role of lncRNAs in the development of carcinoma of uterine body.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cancers"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956797","title":["Table S7 from Deep-Learning Model for Tumor-Type Prediction Using Targeted Clinical Genomic Sequencing Data"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0740-7431","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Madison","family":"Darmofal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9144-1527","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shalabh","family":"Suman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2817-3117","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gurnit","family":"Atwal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8206-6414","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael","family":"Toomey","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4036-6969","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jie-Fu","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1705-1870","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jason C.","family":"Chang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0227-3523","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Efsevia","family":"Vakiani","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5426-0885","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna M.","family":"Varghese","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6104-5665","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anoop","family":"Balakrishnan Rema","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-8702-7984","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aijazuddin","family":"Syed","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0131-4904","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nikolaus","family":"Schultz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3882-5000","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael F.","family":"Berger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2760-6999","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Quaid","family":"Morris","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;All GDD-ENS test set results&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956981.v1","title":["Supplementary Figure 5 from Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Analysis Reveals the Epigenetic Basis and Signature Transcription Factors for the Molecular Subtypes of Colorectal Cancers"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6144-8018","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Zhenyu","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3515-3333","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuqiong","family":"Hu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0001-0631","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Haoling","family":"Xie","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7236-6402","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kexuan","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1773-1876","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lu","family":"Wen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5248-7891","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wei","family":"Fu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4048-4017","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xin","family":"Zhou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8625-7717","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fuchou","family":"Tang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure 5.

Nevertheless, affected by the Paschen effect, the breakdown voltage of these electronics during flight is significantly lower than that on the ground, which could deteriorate system stability, or even cause aircraft faults or crashes, increasing safety risks for the public. As such, condition monitoring of power electronics has become critical for the safe operation of eVTOL. To achieve non-intrusive monitoring, acoustic emissions (AE) sensors have gained traction with their prominent resistance to electromagnetic interference and high temperatures. However, existing studies yield conflicting results regarding whether an increase in loading voltage impacts the internal mechanical stress of electronics. To address this issue, we present this work to probe the existence and the pattern of a relationship between load voltage and stress wave, since the change of mechanical stress could generate acoustic waves that can be acquired by AE sensors. In this study, an AE sensor was applied onto an oscillator placed upon an epoxy substrate to characterize the acoustic waves emitted from the device under various input loads. In the experiment, we observed a unique AE signal pattern characterized by two distinct components that consistently intersect at a specific frequency. The time required to establish such intersections progressively lengthens as the load voltage increases. Through time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of the unique AE signals under different load voltages, it was discovered that certain features of the unique AE signals have an approximately linear relationship with the load voltage.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Electronic Packaging"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btae348","title":["Time-efficient filtering of imaging polarimetric data by checking physical realizability of experimental mueller matrices"],"author":[{"given":"Tatiana","family":"Novikova","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"LPICM, CNRS, Ecole polytechnique, IP Paris , Route de Saclay, Palaiseau, 91120, France"},{"name":"Florida International University Department of Biomedical Engineering, , West Flagler Street, Miami, FL 33174, USA"}]},{"given":"Alexey","family":"Ovchinnikov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Queens College, City University of New York Department of Mathematics, , Kissena Blvd, Queens, NY 11367-1597, USA"}]},{"given":"Gleb","family":"Pogudin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire d\u2019informatique, Ecole Polytechnique, IP Paris , Route de Saclay, Palaiseau, 91120, France"}]},{"given":"Jessica C","family":"Ramella-Roman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Florida International University Department of Biomedical Engineering, , West Flagler Street, Miami, FL 33174, USA"},{"name":"Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, , SW 8th Street, Miami, FL 33199, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Motivation<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Imaging Mueller polarimetry has already proved its potential for biomedicine, remote sensing and metrology.

Of the 148 FLLs, 4 and 3 lesions were categorized as an LR-1 and LR-2, correspondingly, all of which were pathologically benign. 6 lesions were categorised as an LR-3, comprising 3 benign and 3 malignant lesions. The diagnostic accuracy of benign versus malignant lesions was approximately 50%. 18 lesions were categorised as LR-4 including 13 malignant lesions (13\/18, 72.22%); 102 lesions were categorized as LR-5, with 101 pathologically confirmed malignant lesions (101\/102, 99.02%); 8 lesions were categorized as LR-TIV and all of them were malignant; finally, 7 lesions were classified LR-M and with 5 confirmed malignancies (5\/7, 71.43%).\nConclusions\n LR1\/2 and LR4\/5\/TIV\/M demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy for the delineation between benign and malignant lesions respectively.

Chronic UV exposure altered the expression of genes involved in dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Furthermore, chronic peripheral dopamine treatments resulted in memory deficits.

APIC can retrieve complex aberrations of an imaging system with no additional hardware and avoids iterative algorithms, requiring no human-designed convergence metrics while always obtaining a closed-form complex field solution. We experimentally demonstrate that APIC gives correct reconstruction results where Fourier ptychographic microscopy fails when constrained to the same number of measurements. APIC achieves 2.8 times faster computation using image tile size of 256 (length-wise), is robust against aberrations compared to Fourier ptychographic microscopy, and capable of addressing aberrations whose maximal phase difference exceeds 3.8\u03c0 when using a NA 0.25 objective in experiment.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nature Communications"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1103\/physrevlett.132.237401","title":["Network Spreading from Network Dimension"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1552-3755","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jack Murdoch","family":"Moore","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Tongji University"},{"name":"Tongji University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5378-1582","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Michael","family":"Small","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Western Australia"},{"name":"CSIRO"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6196-2615","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Gang","family":"Yan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tongji University"},{"name":"Tongji University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5985-245X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Huijie","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1809-2826","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Changgui","family":"Gu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1903-1208","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Haiying","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Shanghai for Science and Technology"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Continuous-state network spreading models provide critical numerical and analytic insights into transmission processes in epidemiology, rumor propagation, knowledge dissemination, and many other areas.

Here, we propose mitigating this limitation via a network property ideally suited to capturing spreading. This is the network correlation dimension, which characterizes how the number of nodes within range of a source typically scales with distance. Applying the approach to susceptible-infected-recovered processes leads to a spreading model which, for a wide range of networks and epidemic parameters, can provide more accurate predictions of the early stages of a spreading process than important established models of substantially higher complexity.

In this study, numerical simulation and experimental validation methods are employed to establish four different clearance schemes. The analysis focuses on multiple aspects, including the internal flow field, clearance flow field, leakage flow, and recirculation flow, to investigate the impact of axial clearance on the internal flow field and the external characteristics of the vortex pump. The results indicate that under the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet, the main flow leaks from the high-pressure region at the outlet to the clearance flow channel, and the clearance flow returns to the main flow channel at the low-pressure region of the inlet. As the axial clearance increases, the intensity of the vortices inside the pump gradually decreases. This leads to a reduction in intensity of the momentum exchange between the fluid inside and outside the impeller, causing a decline in the pump performance curve. Simultaneously, the increase in clearance reduces the flow resistance in the clearance region, and the clearance flow gradually stabilizes. The interaction between the clearance flow and the main flow intensifies, causing the leakage flow and recirculation flow to increase rapidly, which results in significant energy loss.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Water"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956664","title":["Supplementary Figure S10 from Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Following Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The PETAL Phase Ib Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3529-0103","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David J.","family":"Pinato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9164-3671","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonio","family":"D'Alessio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5654-9225","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Claudia Angela Maria","family":"Fulgenzi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5892-9224","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexandra Emilia","family":"Schlaak","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5662-2162","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ciro","family":"Celsa","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-8538-9251","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Saskia","family":"Killmer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7725-965X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jesus Miguens","family":"Blanco","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-3256-4515","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Caroline","family":"Ward","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8441-6470","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Charalampos-Vlasios","family":"Stikas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6973-3067","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mark R.","family":"Openshaw","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-7064-6601","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicole","family":"Acuti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9764-4288","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Georgios","family":"Nteliopoulos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7927-5538","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cristina","family":"Balcells","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7358-8851","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hector C.","family":"Keun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5184-4519","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert D.","family":"Goldin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2390-1886","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul J.","family":"Ross","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1209-5735","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alessio","family":"Cortellini","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-8373-0518","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Thomas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-9040-5646","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna-Mary","family":"Young","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5416-7971","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nathan","family":"Danckert","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-2783-8069","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul","family":"Tait","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7994-5239","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julian R.","family":"Marchesi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2552-740X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bertram","family":"Bengsch","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2441-549X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rohini","family":"Sharma","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S10.\nBar graphs showing the absence of association between entropy and response prior to the start of pembrolizumab (A) and at the end of treatment (B).

To analyse the postoperative period, another questionnaire was provided 7 days after surgery. The study was conducted on a total of 102 patients (55 men and 47 women), with a mean age of 47.99 years. The results indicated that patients with a high and severe degree of anxiety had a poorer quality of life in general. Patients with a higher degree of anxiety perceived greater swelling at 24, 48, 72 h and one week after surgery.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Dentistry Journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.47149\/pemo.v6.e12634","title":["Integra\u00e7\u00e3o de conhecimentos: experimentos cient\u00edficos em Ci\u00eancias Naturais em uma escola p\u00fablica de Altamira-PA"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0475-4905","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ronaldo dos Santos","family":"Leonel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8340-4657","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andr\u00e9ia de Oliveira","family":"Castro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5441-7595","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ant\u00f4nio dos Santos","family":"Leonel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Este estudo investigou a efic\u00e1cia de experimentos interdisciplinares de Ci\u00eancias da Natureza no ensino fundamental.

Fifty-five hemodialysis patients aged 51\u201360 years were selected from among CKD-ESKD patients. Males outnumbered females in the sample.

service having specific latency constraints and computational requirements. Deploying such a variety of services while matching their requirements with the available computing resources is challenging. In addition, time-critical services may have to be migrated as the users move, to keep fulfilling their latency constraints. Unlike previous work relying on an orchestrator with an always-updated global view of the available resources and the users\u2019 locations, this work envisions a distributed solution to the above problems. In particular, we propose a distributed asynchronous framework for service deployment in the edge-cloud that increases the system resilience by avoiding a single point of failure, as in the case of a central orchestrator. Our solution ensures cost-efficient feasible placement of services, while using negligible bandwidth. Our results, obtained through trace-driven, large-scale simulations, show that the proposed solution provides performance very close to those obtained by state-of-the-art centralized solutions, and at the cost of a small communication overhead.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1186\/s12885-024-12447-8","title":["Trifluridine\u2013tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus trifluridine\u2013tipiracil monotherapy for chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0623-8135","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Francisco Cezar","family":"Aquino de Moraes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3825-5212","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Felipe Dirc\u00eau","family":"Dantas Leite Pess\u00f4a","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-0069-5648","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Caio Henrique","family":"Duarte de Castro Ribeiro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1396-3442","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marianne","family":"Rodrigues Fernandes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4872-234X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rommel Mario","family":"Rodr\u00edguez Burbano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8087-7037","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ney Pereira","family":"Carneiro dos Santos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.

Using data from the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), we analyzed the distribution of PRL in 3,369 community-dwelling European men, aged 40\u201380 years at phase-1 and free from acute illnesses. In total, 2,948 and 2,644 PRL samples were collected during phase-1 and phase-2 (3 to 5.7 years later). All samples were analysed in the same centre with the same assay. After excluding individuals with known pituitary diseases, PRL\u2009\u2265\u200935 ng\/ml, and PRL-altering drugs including antipsychotic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or dopamine agonists, 5,086 data points (2,845 in phase-1 and 2,241 in phase-2) were available for analysis. The results showed that PRL declined minimally with age (slope = -0.02) and did not correlate with BMI. The positively skewed PRL distribution was log-transformed to a symmetrical distribution (skewness reduced from 13.3 to 0.015). Using two-sigma empirical rule (2[]SD about the mean), a threshold at 2.5% of the lower end of the distribution was shown to correspond to a PRL value of 2.98ng\/ml. With reference to individuals with PRL levels of 5-34.9 ng\/ml (event rate\u2009=\u20096.3%), the adjusted risk of developing type 2 diabetes increased progressively in those with PRL levels of 3-4.9 ng\/ml: event rate\u2009=\u20099.3%, OR (95% CI) 1.59 (0.93\u20132.71), and more so with PRL levels of 0.3\u20132.9 ng\/ml: event rate\u2009=\u200922.7%, OR 5.45 (1.78\u201316.62).

However, most arc magmas are barren and giant economic porphyry Cu \u00b1 Au deposits are rare. In this study, we model variations in rare earth element concentrations in the evolving arc magmas and giant porphyry Cu \u00b1 Au systems to quantify the percentage of the fractionating minerals required to produce the observed changes. We find that, during the andesitic stage of fractionation, ore-forming systems in thick crusts fractionate ~35% more amphibole than an average of thick arc magma systems (the thick-crust reference suite) and that ore-forming systems in thin crusts fractionate twice as much amphibole as their equivalent thin-arc magma reference suite. Thick-crust ore-forming suites also fractionate ~50% less plagioclase, and thin-crust ore systems ~40% less plagioclase, than their associated reference suites during the same andesitic stage of fractionation. Taken together, these observations imply that ore-producing magmas are appreciably wetter than their associated barren reference suites. Our modelling also shows that 80% more amphibole is required to reproduce the andesite stage of fractionation in the thick-crust reference suite than in its thin-crust equivalent, suggesting that magmas produced under thick crusts are wetter than those produced under thin crusts. On the other hand, the chalcophile element contents of the thick- and thin-crust ore-forming systems are similar to and higher than those of the thick- and thin-crust reference suites, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that the high water content plays a critical role in the formation of giant porphyry Cu ore in thick crusts, whereas both high chalcophile contents and high water contents are required to form giant porphyry Cu-Au deposits in thin crusts.<\/jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The high fraction of amphibole fractionation in giant economic porphyry suites, compared with their relevant reference suites, results in lower Y in the ore-associated suites and this difference increases with fractionation.

This study aims to clarify this issue by assessing the relationship between LNY and long-term survival in elderly patients with RSCC.\nMethods\n Data from the SEER database (split into 7:3 training and testing sets) and patients from the colorectal surgery departments of two tertiary hospitals in China (validation set) were analyzed. Elderly patients with stages I-III RSCC undergoing resection were included. The correlation between LNY and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by a multivariate model and the application of the restricted cubic spline curve (RCS). The odds ratios (ORs) for stage migration and the hazard ratios (HRs) for OS with increased LNY were estimated using Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS), with structural breakpoints identified using the Chow test.\nResults\n The distribution of LNY was similar across the training (median: 18, IQR [14, 23]), testing (median: 18, IQR [14, 23]), and validation (median: 17, IQR [14, 20]) sets.

Based on the direct numerical simulation results of supersonic compressible plate TBLs with Mach number of 2.9, the geometric and dynamic characteristics of TNTI are investigated in this paper. The interface is identified by the enstrophy method, and the height, thickness, fractal dimension, enstrophy transportation and entrainment characteristics of the interface are investigated. It is found that for the enstrophy transportation in a TBL, the contribution of compressibility-related terms accounts for approximately 13.4\u00a0% of the total enstrophy transportation, which tends to transfer the enstrophy of turbulence near the interface to both directions vertical to the interface. This promotes the expansion of the turbulent region towards the non-turbulent region, and the mean height, thickness and entrainment velocity are increased by approximately 3.7\u00a0%, 7.0\u00a0% and 8.5\u00a0%, respectively, while the fractal dimension is basically unaffected. Different from the incompressible flow, the contribution of the compressibility-related terms to the entrainment velocity is independent of the local curvature, and the intense entrainment process is more likely to occur on a highly curved concave surface.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Fluid Mechanics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2024.1282742","title":["Gut microbiota and postpartum depression: a Mendelian randomization study"],"author":[{"given":"Jianjun","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lechuan","family":"Wei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hongfei","family":"Tan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenwen","family":"Pang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>Increasing evidence suggests a correlation between intestinal microbiota and the gut-brain axis; however, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and postpartum depression (PPD) remains unclear.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>In this study, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was employed to analyze the GWAS data of gut microorganisms from the Mibiogen database and PPD data from the UK biobank.

The cisternal progression and the stable compartment models have been proposed and are under debate. Classic cisternal progression model posits that both the intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit of secretory cargos should occur at a constant velocity dictated by the cisternal progression; furthermore, COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport is essential for maintaining the Golgi organization. Leveraging our recently developed Golgi imaging tools in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks, we found that the intra-Golgi transport velocity of a secretory cargo decreases during their transition from the cis to the trans-side of the Golgi, and different cargos exhibit distinct velocities even within the same cisternae. We observed a vast variation in the Golgi residence times of different cargos. Remarkably, truncation of the luminal domain causes the Golgi residence time of Tac \u2014 a standard transmembrane secretory cargo without intra-Golgi recycling signals \u2014 to extend from 16 minutes to a notable 3.4 hours. Additionally, when COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport was inhibited by brefeldin A, we found that nocodazole-induced Golgi can remain stacked for over 30 - 60 minutes. Therefore, our findings challenge the classical cisternal progression model and suggest the stable compartment nature of the Golgi.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.52273\/sduhfd..1459624","title":["Konut Kiras\u0131na \u0130li\u015fkin Uyu\u015fmazl\u0131klarda Ta\u015f\u0131nmaz\u0131n Aile Konutu Niteli\u011finin Arabuluculuk S\u00fcrecine Etkisi"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4161-3765","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Duygu","family":"Da\u011fl\u0131o\u011flu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"GAZ\u0130ANTEP \u00dcN\u0130VERS\u0130TES\u0130, HUKUK FAK\u00dcLTES\u0130"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Arabuluculuk m\u00fcessesesi 6325 Say\u0131l\u0131 Hukuk Uyu\u015fmazl\u0131klar\u0131nda Arabuluculuk Kanunu ile 2013 y\u0131l\u0131nda T\u00fcrk hukukuna girmi\u015ftir.

Some chemical contaminants, like pesticides, are embedded in natural biogeochemical cycles.

The PDMS polymeric phase was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PDMS-coated needles were used for extraction of thirteen pesticides by direct-immersion solid-phase microextraction (DI-SPME) from contaminated waters, followed by determination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

High-risk and relapsed cases have less than 50% and near 5% survival, respectively. The current standard of care is highly genotoxic, resulting in life-long health issues and an increased risk of new cancer incidence. Effective and less toxic approaches to neuroblastoma remain elusive. We show here that \u03c93 and \u03c96 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) have differential effects on tumor formation in a syngeneic model of neuroblastoma. We observe that 20 gram\/d doses of \u03c93 DHA and EPA have a robust antitumor effect, wherein DHA and high-dose EPA completely abrogate tumor formation. In contrast, \u03c96 arachidonic acid (ARA) has the opposite effect, driving higher tumor penetrance and shorter latency. When used together, ARA and EPA treatment results in a reduced tumor burden analogous to the control group, indicating that EPA may directly oppose the mechanism of ARA-mediated tumor formation. ROS-resistant deuterated DHA (D-DHA), which has deuterium atoms in place of ordinary 1H (protium) in the oxidatively labile bis allylic positions, also completely abrogated tumor formation, strongly suggesting that the mechanism of action is not through oxidation as might have been expected. Interestingly, despite high levels of fatty acid delivery, very little tissue accumulation was observed. These results suggest that high doses of \u03c93 HUFA DHA and EPA may represent a viable, low-toxicity avenue for neuroblastoma therapy.\u2003<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/cmdc.202400186","title":["Russell Mechanism\u2010Mediated Cancer Therapy: A Minireview"],"author":[{"given":"Rufeng","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Digital Medical Engineering Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering Southeast University 2 Southeast University Road  Nanjing 211189 P.

From an economic point of view, with regard to yield, cost of production and profit margin for cheese production, we were faced with a total refusal of response from the producers. However, the quantity of milk used per day, the quantity of cheese obtained and the unit price per kg of cheese vary from one producer to another.\r\nConclusion: This study has led to the realization that milk is the\u00a0\u00a0 source of livelihood for the farmer and his family but also for other consumers. The income from the sale of milk contributes to the purchase of food for the farmer\u2019s household and livestock supplements. However, the size of the herd and the low production of milk are an obstacle to the development of this sector.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Asian Journal of Agricultural Extension, Economics &amp; Sociology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1002\/ange.202317468","title":["Revealing the Mechanism of Combining Best Properties of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis in Hybrid Pd\/NHC Systems"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5677-2112","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Darya O.","family":"Prima","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2098-0977","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Natalia S.","family":"Kulikovskaya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3740-7424","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Roman A.","family":"Novikov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4099-1019","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexander Yu.","family":"Kostyukovich","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6286-1699","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julia V.","family":"Burykina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9182-8564","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Victor M.","family":"Chernyshev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Platov South-Russian State Polytechnic University (NPI)  Prosveschenya 132 Novocherkassk 346428 Russia."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6447-557X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Valentine P.","family":"Ananikov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences  Leninsky prospekt 47 Moscow 119991 Russia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with <jats:italic>N<\/jats:italic>\u2010heterocyclic carbene ligands (M\/NHC).

To gain insights into the potential functions of SETD2, a comprehensive study was conducted utilizing a co-culture model of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (THP-1). A range of techniques were employed, including quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, ELISA, alkaline phosphatase activity assays, alizarin red S staining, luciferase reporter gene assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, to unravel the intricate interactions and molecular mechanisms involving SETD2 in this system. It was observed that SETD2 expression was reduced in THP-1 cells stimulated by staphylococcal protein A (SPA). Furthermore, the downregulation of SETD2 resulted in elevated M1 macrophage polarization and glycolysis, effects that were mitigated by SPA stimulation. Notably, SPA-stimulated THP-1 cells exhibited an increase in HIF-1\u03b1 expression, which exhibited an inverse correlation with SETD2 levels. Moreover, it was discovered that SETD2 functioned as a catalyst for H3K36me3 and bound to the HIF-1\u03b1 gene, which, in turn, regulated HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Furthermore, the suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 abrogated the consequences of SETD2 downregulation on glycolysis and M1 macrophage polarization. Lastly, the study demonstrated that M1 macrophage polarization serves as a mediator for BMP4\u2019s inhibitory effect on osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. This research has uncovered a previously unknown role of SETD2 in macrophages during osteomyelitis, revealing its significance in the pathogenesis of this condition.

The primary purpose of this study is to forecast connected disciplinary thought through a novel bibliometric model, in the development of \u2018co-theory analysis\u2019, thereby identifying potential transdisciplinary collaboration gaps capable of effectively addressing transdisciplinary research in the field of construction project management through a theocratic lens of transdisciplinary perspectives. This novel method of exploring interdisciplinary theory utilises a detailed bibliometric analysis of project management literature from Scopus by identifying its interconnected relationship with construction project management, categorising papers by theory to reveal interdisciplinary intersections and potential collaborations. It statistically predicts research effectiveness, providing a roadmap for success across a series of disciplines. The analysis reveals significant, yet previously unexplored, theoretical intersections with a focus on construction project management and other co-keyword disciplines, cointegrated through theory to systematically map and analyse patterns in academic literature trends. These intersections suggest specific areas where collaborative research yields substantial potential advancements. Additionally, the study further identifies key institutions and academic experts whose combined expertise could be pivotal in bridging these identified research gaps.

A recent report unveiled a type of riboswitch, known as the guanidine-IV riboswitch, which responds to guanidine levels to regulate downstream genetic transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which the riboswitch senses its target ligand and undergoes conformational changes remain elusive. This gap in understanding has impeded the potential applications of this riboswitch. To bridge this knowledge gap, our study investigated the conformational dynamics of the guanidine-IV riboswitch RNA upon ligand binding. We employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to dissect the behaviors of the aptamer, terminator, and full-length riboswitch. Our findings indicated that the aptamer portion exhibited higher sensitivity to guanidine compared to the terminator and full-length constructs. Additionally, we utilized Position-specific Labelling of RNA (PLOR) combined with smFRET to observe, at the single-nucleotide and single-molecule level, the structural transitions experienced by the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription. Notably, we discovered that the influence of guanidine on the riboswitch RNA\u2019s conformations was significantly reduced after the transcription of 88 nucleotides. Furthermore, we proposed a folding model for the guanidine-IV riboswitch in the absence and presence of guanidine, thereby providing insights into its ligand-response mechanism.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1063\/5.0206503","title":["The C1s core levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and styrenic polymers: A first-principles study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6675-7829","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Laura","family":"Galleni","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven 1 , Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1777-8578","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniel","family":"Escudero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven 1 , Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001 Leuven, Belgium"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2597-8534","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Geoffrey","family":"Pourtois","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"IMEC 2 , Kapeldreef 75, 3001 Leuven, Belgium"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0557-5260","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michiel J.","family":"van Setten","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"IMEC 2 , Kapeldreef 75, 3001 Leuven, Belgium"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Understanding core level shifts in aromatic compounds is crucial for the correct interpretation of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including acenes, as well as of styrenic polymers, which are increasingly relevant for the microelectronic industry, among other applications. The effect of delocalization through \u03c0 aromatic systems on the stabilization of valence molecular orbitals has been widely investigated in the past. However, little has been reported on the impact on the deeper C1s core energy levels. In this work, we use first-principles calculations at the level of many body perturbation theory to compute the C1s binding energies of several aromatic systems. We report a C1s red shift in PAHs and acenes of increasing size, both in the gas phase and in the molecular crystal. C1s red shifts are also calculated for stacked benzene and naphthalene pairs at decreasing intermolecular distances. A C1s red shift is in addition found between oligomers of poly(p-hydroxystyrene) and polystyrene of increasing length, which we attribute to ring\u2013ring interactions between the side-chains. The predicted shifts are larger than common instrumental errors and could, therefore, be detected in XPS experiments.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Journal of Chemical Physics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/ajh\/hpae074","title":["Association of a healthy lifestyle with ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure among Chinese youths: a cross-sectional study"],"author":[{"given":"Bin","family":"Mao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology of Hunan Province, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University , Changsha, 410081, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3297-1306","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yide","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology of Hunan Province, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University , Changsha, 410081, China"}]},{"given":"Zehui","family":"Fan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology of Hunan Province, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University , Changsha, 410081, China"}]},{"given":"Yuxian","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology of Hunan Province, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University , Changsha, 410081, China"}]},{"given":"Wanyun","family":"Xiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology of Hunan Province, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University , Changsha, 410081, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8123-4401","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bin","family":"Dong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University Health Science Center , Beijing 100191, China"}]},{"given":"Jie","family":"Hu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Brisbane , Queensland 4111, Australia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Background<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study aims to explore the association between a healthy lifestyle and abnormal ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in Chinese youths.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A school-based sample of 1,296 college students was investigated.

Current FDA-approved RAF inhibitors selectively inhibit the monomeric BRAF\nV600E\n and suffer from tumor resistance. Recently, dimer-selective and equipotent RAF inhibitors have been developed; however, the mechanism of dimer selectivity is poorly understood. Here, we report extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the monomeric and dimeric BRAF\nV600E\n in the apo form or in complex with one or two dimer-selective (PHI1) or equipotent (LY3009120) inhibitor(s). The simulations uncovered the unprecedented details of the remarkable allostery in BRAF\nV600E\n dimerization and inhibitor binding. Specifically, dimerization retrains and shifts the \n\u03b1\nC helix inward and increases the flexibility of the DFG motif; dimer compatibility is due to the promotion of the \n\u03b1\nC-in conformation, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond formation between the inhibitor and the \n\u03b1\nC Glu501. A more stable hydrogen bond further restrains and shifts the \n\u03b1\nC helix inward, which incurs a larger entropic penalty that disfavors monomer binding. This mechanism led us to propose an empirical way based on the co-crystal structure to assess the dimer selectivity of a BRAF\nV600E\n inhibitor. Simulations also revealed that the positive cooperativity of PHI1 is due to its ability to preorganize the \n\u03b1\nC and DFG conformation in the opposite protomer, priming it for binding the second inhibitor. The atomically detailed view of the interplay between BRAF dimerization and inhibitor allostery as well as cooperativity has implications for understanding kinase signaling and contributes to the design of protomer selective RAF inhibitors.\n<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.37376\/1571-000-053-004","title":["\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0647\u064f

Despite the advent of numerous isotropic compliant parallel mechanisms, their synthesis process predominantly relies on the empirical knowledge of engineers, with an absence of dedicated synthesis methodologies. This paper proposes the constraint algebra method, a novel synthesis method capable of autonomously exploring feasible constraint space for the synthesis. This method involves algebraic formulation of the constraints for the compliant modules, followed by solving constraint equations to find the feasible constraints and orientations, thereby facilitating the synthesis with intended performance characteristics. The multiplicity of solutions to the constraint equations enables the generation of diverse designs, including innovative configurations that are challenging to obtain via other methods and experience. Furthermore, by the consideration of machinability in several steps of synthesis, the optimal configuration can be selected for simplified manufacture. A design case has been monolithically prototyped and experimentally tested. The proposed methodology holds promise for potential extension to the synthesis of other types of compliant mechanisms.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Mechanical Design"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956323.v1","title":["Supplementary Figure S6 from A Prospective Double-Blinded Comparison of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy with Conventional Histopathology for &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;\/i&gt; Assessment in Oral Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5240-8989","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniella K.","family":"Zanoni","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4316-8834","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paula","family":"Dem\u00e9trio De Souza Fran\u00e7a","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3397-2888","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cristina","family":"Valero","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0091-9602","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gary","family":"Peterson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5772-4937","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marco","family":"Ardigo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2802-8489","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ronald","family":"Ghossein","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0747-2479","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephen W.","family":"Dusza","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9490-3619","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Danielli","family":"Matsuura","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7784-1244","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Daniel W.","family":"Scholfield","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5555-2019","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dauren","family":"Adilbay","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1297-9469","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pablo H.","family":"Montero","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5882-0728","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jocelyn","family":"Migliacci","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1750-7436","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Naga Vara Kishore","family":"Pillarsetty","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3185-2639","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kivanc","family":"Kose","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7636-5426","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ian","family":"Ganly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6323-4547","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Milind","family":"Rajadhyaksha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9775-5132","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Snehal G.","family":"Patel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S6 shows in vivo RCM images of a tumor area in a 61-year-old male, with a recurrent 1 cm moderately differentiated invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma of the left ventral tongue.&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/milmed\/usae267","title":["Preliminary Evidence for the Role of Fungi, Specifically <i>Chaetomium<\/i>, in Gulf War Illness"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6411-7476","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John W","family":"Cherwonogrodzky","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Biothreats Consulting Incorporated , Medicine Hat, Alberta T1A 8M3, Canada"}]},{"given":"Tzuyung D","family":"Kou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western University School of Medicine , Cleveland, OH 44106, USA"}]},{"given":"Robert R","family":"Rennie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Mackenzie Health Science Centre, University of Alberta , Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2B7, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>For veterans of the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991), dozens of possible causes for their illness have been proposed.

Explaining this disparity is challenging as similar evolutionary triggers often do not result in analogous shifts across the tree, and similar shifts may reflect different evolutionary triggers. We used a combination of approaches to directly consider such context-dependency and untangle the complex network of processes that shape macroevolutionary dynamics, focusing on Pleurodonta, a diverse radiation of lizards. Our approach shows that some lineage-wide signatures are lost when conditioned on sublineages: while viviparity appears to accelerate diversification, its effect size is overestimated by its association with the Andean mountains. Conversely, some signals that erode at broader phylogenetic scales emerge at shallower ones. Mountains, in general, do not affect speciation rates; rather, the occurrence in the Andean mountains specifically promotes diversification. Likewise, the evolution of larger sizes catalyzes diversification rates, but only within certain ecological and geographical settings. We caution that conventional methods of fitting models to entire trees may mistakenly assign diversification heterogeneity to specific factors despite evidence against their plausibility. Our study takes a significant stride toward disentangling confounding factors and identifying plausible sources of ecological opportunities in the diversification of large evolutionary radiations.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Evolution Letters"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/icesjms\/fsae069","title":["Risks of regionalized stock assessments for widely distributed species like the panmictic European eel"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6009-4665","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Leander","family":"H\u00f6hne","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Th\u00fcnen Institute of Fisheries Ecology , 27572 Bremerhaven , Germany"}]},{"given":"C\u00e9dric","family":"Briand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Eaux & Vilaine , 56130 La Roche Bernard , France"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8919-6318","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marko","family":"Freese","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Th\u00fcnen Institute of Fisheries Ecology , 27572 Bremerhaven , Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0748-7128","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lasse","family":"Marohn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Th\u00fcnen Institute of Fisheries Ecology , 27572 Bremerhaven , Germany"}]},{"given":"Jan-Dag","family":"Pohlmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Th\u00fcnen Institute of Fisheries Ecology , 27572 Bremerhaven , Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5131-4542","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tessa","family":"van\u00a0der\u00a0Hammen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Wageningen Marine Research, Wageningen University and Research , PO Box 68, 1970 AB IJmuiden , The Netherlands"}]},{"given":"Reinhold","family":"Hanel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Th\u00fcnen Institute of Fisheries Ecology , 27572 Bremerhaven , Germany"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In fisheries management, accurate stock assessment is pivotal to determine sustainable harvest levels or the scope of conservation measures.

To enable recovery of the critically endangered European eel, EU countries must fulfill a biomass target of potential spawner (\u201csilver eel\u201d) escapement, while local eel stock assessment approaches vary widely. We summarize local approaches and results of ground-truthing studies based on direct silver eel monitoring, to evaluate the accuracy of eel stock assessments in retrospect and identify bias sources. A substantial fraction of eel habitat is currently unassessed or assessed by unvalidated approaches. Across assessment models for which validation exists, demographic models frequently overestimated actual escapement, while misestimations of extrapolation (\u201cspatial\u201d) models were more balanced, slightly underestimating escapement. Stock size overestimation may lead to overexploitation or insufficient conservation measures, increasing the risk of stock collapse or slow recovery in coordinated frameworks. Underestimations may imply inefficient allocation of conservation efforts or negatively affect socioeconomy.

This simulation uses two treated geometry models: with or without surface roughness on HFMI groove, and two material properties: S690QL and AH36 structural steels. The results show that surface roughness and load history, including high-peak loads, significantly influence fatigue response. It is revealed that the model neglecting the surface roughness cannot represent the amount of residual stress change and fatigue damage at less than 100 \u00b5m depth from the surface. In addition, the local yield strength in the HFMI-treated zone affects the plasticity behavior near the surface imperfection under the high-peak loads, which provides comparatively different fatigue damage between S690QL and AH36 in some cases.

Here, we combine remote sensing imagery analysis and morphodynamic simulations to demonstrate that the deflection of alongshore tidal currents at transitions in bed elevation determines the characteristic orientation of the parallel tidal channels. Numerical results reveal that sharp changes in bed elevation lead to nearly 90-degree intersection angles, while smoother transitions in bed profiles result in less perpendicular channel alignments. These findings shed light on the potential manipulation of tidal channel patterns in coastal wetlands, thus equipping coastal managers with a broader range of strategies for the sustainable management of these vital ecosystems in the face of climate change and sea level rise.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nature Communications"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.53964\/jmer.2024010","title":["Taiwanese Teachers\u2019 Beliefs Toward EFL Learner Autonomy and Their Practices in High School"],"author":[{"given":"Kuan-wei Patrick","family":"Lin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This study examines English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers\u2019 beliefs and actual practices regarding promoting learner autonomy (LA) in the high school classroom.

In immunocompromised individuals, posttransplant malignancies pose a significant health concern, with DCs serving as vital players in immune responses against cancer cells. Both recipient- and donor-derived DCs play a critical role in the rejection process, infiltrating the transplanted organ and sustaining T-cell responses. The use of immunosuppressive drugs represents the predominant approach to control this immunological barrier in transplanted organs. Evidence has shed light on the immunopharmacology of these drugs and novel strategies for manipulating DCs to promote allograft survival. Therefore, comprehending the mechanisms underlying this intricate microenvironment and the effects of immunosuppressive therapy on DCs is crucial for developing targeted therapies to reduce graft failure rates.

Randomized controlled trials involving yoga for the treatment of SUD have identified its potential to decrease the risk of relapse, improve mood and wellbeing; however, the therapeutic mechanisms outlining how this occurs is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the in-depth experience of yoga to inform the treatment of SUD.  Methods: Five semi structured interviews (self-identified as Male=2; Female=3; Mage=35.2, SD=7.60) exploring experiences of yoga among people with a prior history of substance use. Participants reported prior use of alcohol (n=4) and \u2018GBL\u2019 and methamphetamine (n=1). Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Analysis resulted in three final superordinate themes. Yoga was reported to enhance awareness of muscle tension, reduce physical stress, increase positive emotions, and build tolerance to negative emotions. The integration of the eight-limb philosophy of yoga, notably withdrawing of the senses, helped combat internal cues and triggers (negative thoughts and emotions) for relapse. Yoga was reported to be compatible with an abstinence-based lifestyle found in 12-step mutual aid programs and helped extend social networks to support long term abstinence.  Conclusions: The integration of the eight-limb philosophy, notably withdrawing of the senses appears to reduce cue reactivity making it a valuable tool to integrate within mainstream group and individual relapse prevention programs. Yoga asana also appears to enhance interoceptive awareness which is useful for reducing physical stress related to triggers for relapse. Therefore, treatment programs and health policymakers may want to consider integrating a yoga-based counselling model to enhance and support long term abstinence for SUD.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fnut.2024.1418120","title":["Influence of thermal denaturation on whey protein isolates in combination with chitosan for fabricating Pickering emulsions: a comparison study"],"author":[{"given":"Yilin","family":"Pu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yuxiang","family":"Long","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Die","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yongkang","family":"Niu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qinglong","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shiyu","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ruozhen","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ruihong","family":"Ge","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Composite natural emulsifiers such as whey protein isolate (WPI) and chitosan (CS) are commonly used in Pickering emulsions to address the effect of thermal deformation of proteins before complexation with CS and heating after complexation.

The power sector is a major global greenhouse gas emitter, particularly in Indonesia. Indonesia\u2019s electricity sector emitted 149.90 million tons of CO2eq greenhouse gas in 2020, which is expected to increase to 158.30 million tons of CO2eq in 2021. Indonesia has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement has been ratified into national law, accommodating Indonesia\u2019s roadmap to net zero by 2060. The emissions reduction target was published in 2022 through the enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). This study aims to analyze the impact of climate policy in Indonesia\u2019s electricity sector to meet the net zero emissions target by 2060. Projection and calculation in this study were conducted using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP). Data from 2020, including electricity demand, existing capacity, energy production, energy intensity, lifetime, and capacity factor, were used to support LEAP analysis. The data were obtained from the PLN statistical book, PLN sustainability report, Indonesia\u2019s statistical book, and climate change mitigation and adaptation reports in Indonesia. This study developed three climate scenarios, including business as usual (BAU), sustainable development (SD), and low-carbon development (LCD). These scenarios draw upon current climate policies that have various impacts on electricity generation in Indonesia. Based on LEAP analysis, by 2060, energy demand is expected to increase to 300.36 MTOE (BAU), 200.93 MTOE (SD), and 76.97 MTOE (LCD). Consequently, each climate scenario requires an increase in installed capacity to 821.82 GW (BAU), 727.06 GW (SD), and 334.58 GW (LCD). The renewable energy mix is projected to be 21% (BAU), 69% (SD), and 100% (LCD). Each scenario requires investment to develop capacity to meet energy demand.

We investigated whether chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed toward the disialoganglioside GD2 can represent a potentially more effective treatment with reduced long-term side effects.&lt;\/p&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;p&gt;GD2 expression was evaluated on primary tumor biopsies of MB children by flow cytometry. GD2 expression in MB cells was also evaluated in response to an EZH2 inhibitor (tazemetostat).

Isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from samples of the Day 14. The relative mRNA expression of YAP was examined before and after the osteogenic induction of MSCs.

These positively-charged derivatives gained activity against both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and boosted Plasmodium falciparum inhibition to the double-digit nanomolar range. Overcoming and remaining inside the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is one of the major difficulties in antibacterial drug development. The eNTRy rules (N = ionisable nitrogen, T = low three-dimensionality, R = rigidity) can be a useful structural guideline to improve accumulation of small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. With the aim of unlocking Gram-negative activity, we added amines and (cyclic) N-alkyl guanidines to an already flat and rigid pyrazole-amide class. To test their performance, we compared these eNTRy-rule-complying compounds to closely related non-complying ones through phenotypic assay screenings of various pathogens (P. falciparum, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and M. tuberculosis) obtaining a handful of broad-spectrum hits. The results support the working hypothesis and even extend its applicability, the studied pyrazole-amide class adheres to the eNTRy rules; non-compliant compounds do not kill any of the bacteria tested, while compliant compounds largely showed inhibition of Gram-negative, -positive, and M. tuberculosis bacteria in the single-digit micromolar range.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956771","title":["Supplementary Table S4 from Efficacy and Safety of Adagrasib plus Cetuximab in Patients with &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G12C&lt;\/sup&gt;-Mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7233-5454","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rona","family":"Yaeger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3449-1680","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nataliya V.","family":"Uboha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-2448-3478","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Meredith S.","family":"Pelster","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7721-1699","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tanios S.","family":"Bekaii-Saab","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-4259-7457","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Minal","family":"Barve","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1869-9887","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joel","family":"Saltzman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1556-1543","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joshua K.","family":"Sabari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9464-4901","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julio A.","family":"Peguero","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-6023-670X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andrew Scott","family":"Paulson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7821-4928","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pasi A.","family":"J\u00e4nne","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8147-7457","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marcia","family":"Cruz-Correa","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4515-2011","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kenna","family":"Anderes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-9909-6288","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Karen","family":"Velastegui","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1945-0453","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xiaohong","family":"Yan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9902-5712","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hirak","family":"Der-Torossian","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4062-0808","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Samuel J.","family":"Klempner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9647-3416","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Scott E.","family":"Kopetz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Table S4.

the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in lung cancer is critical to improving patient outcomes. We identified four histology-independent archetype TMEs in treatment-na\u00efve early-stage lung cancer using imaging mass cytometry in the TRACERx study (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;\/i&gt; = 81 patients\/198 samples\/2.3 million cells). In immune-hot adenocarcinomas, spatial niches of T cells and macrophages increased with clonal neoantigen burden, whereas such an increase was observed for niches of plasma and B cells in immune-excluded squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC). Immune-low TMEs were associated with fibroblast barriers to immune infiltration. The fourth archetype, characterized by sparse lymphocytes and high tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) infiltration, had tumor cells spatially separated from vasculature and exhibited low spatial intratumor heterogeneity. TAN-high LUSC had frequent &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;\/i&gt; mutations. TAN-high tumors harbored recently expanded and metastasis-seeding subclones and had a shorter disease-free survival independent of stage. These findings delineate genomic, immune, and physical barriers to immune surveillance and implicate neutrophil-rich TMEs in metastasis.&lt;\/p&gt;Significance:&lt;p&gt;This study provides novel insights into the spatial organization of the lung cancer TME in the context of tumor immunogenicity, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution. Pairing the tumor evolutionary history with the spatially resolved TME suggests mechanistic hypotheses for tumor progression and metastasis with implications for patient outcome and treatment.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/aacrjournals.org\/cancerdiscovery\/article\/doi\/10.1158\/2159-8290.CD-14-6-ITI\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;This article is featured in Selected Articles from This Issue, p. 897&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.37376\/1571-000-053-007","title":["In vitro and in vivo inhibition of Gammarus pulex acetylcholinesterase by diazinon"],"author":[{"given":"Salem","family":"Elwahaishi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wesam","family":"F A Mohamed","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alan","family":"Hargreaves","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chris","family":"Lloyd Mills","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This study was designed to investigate the effect of the in vivo and in vitro exposure to the organophosphorothioate pesticide diazinon, its metabolite diazinon oxon and diazinon in a commercial formulation on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex. Only diazinon oxon at concentrations of \u2265 50x103 nM oxon caused a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in vitro. However, diazinon oxon had no significant impact on the enzyme activity following in vivo exposure. The latter mode of exposure to either \u2265 10 nM of diazinon or \u2265 5 nM of the diazinon in the commercial formulation caused a significant reduction in AChE activity of treated organisms.

This method aims to help teachers bridge the gap between basic descriptive statistics and the more advanced concepts of PCA; this is done by disregarding mathematical optimization, while emphasizing the use of summary tables and the programming language R.

However, \u03b5 is still under-predicted.Examination of the un-averaged acoustic backscatter data suggests\nelevated \u03b5 is related to the presence of turbulent structures in the DWL\nwhich span the layer height and strongly modulate TKE. Evolution in the\nbulk Richardson number each day suggests the DWLs become unstable to\nlayer-scale overturning and entrainment each afternoon, thus the\nturbulent structures may result from shear-driven instability. This\ninterpretation is supported by a conditional average of the data during\na burst characterized by strongly periodic structures. The structures\nresemble high-frequency internal waves with strong asymmetry in the\nalong-flow direction (steepening) which suggests they are unstable.\nCoincident asymmetric patterns in upwelling\/downwelling and\ncorresponding regions of strong vertical convergence\/divergence suggest\nboth vertical transport and local TKE generation are plausible sources\nof elevated \u03b5 in the DWL.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1038\/s44310-024-00013-w","title":["Voice interactive information metasurface system for simultaneous wireless information transmission and power transfer"],"author":[{"given":"Zan Kui","family":"Meng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yan","family":"Shi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Quan Wei","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wen Yue","family":"Wei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ru","family":"Hui","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shao Ze","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shi Han","family":"Dai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Qian","family":"Ma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tie Jun","family":"Cui","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Intelligent voice interaction offers a flexible and powerful way to connect individuals with smart devices beyond our expectations. The real-time nature of voice communication enables smart devices to comprehend the user language, execute the corresponding instructions, and facilitate seamless communications, transforming our lives in unprecedented ways. Owing to self-adaptive and reprogrammable functionalities, information metasurface (IMS) opens up a new avenue for smart home and smart cities. To further enhance the intelligence of IMS, we propose an IMS system via intelligent voice interaction and information processing. The voice interaction enables the efficient remote control on the IMS in a flexible, convenient, touchless manner. Leveraging speech recognition, speech synthesis, target detection, and communication technologies, the IMS system achieves automatic beam manipulation capabilities for wireless information transmissions and wireless power transfers. The IMS system is designed to operate in two distinct modes: instruction mode, wherein the user instructs the operations, and autonomous mode, wherein the automatic detections govern the actions, in which seamless mode switching through the voice commands is supported. Users can flexibly achieve precise control over the functions of the intelligent metasurface system through voice interaction at a distance, without the need for close-range manual touch control, which greatly simplifies the operation difficulty and is particularly suitable for remote control and complex application scenarios. A series of experiments, including wireless video transmissions and wireless power transfers are conducted to demonstrate the flexibility and convenience of the IMS system.

A total of 48 strains obtained from citrus production areas in Burkina Faso in 2012, 2020, and 2021 were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests using specific primers. The aim was to examine the distribution of type 3 effectors (T3E) and determine the geographical origins of the strains. The examination of the distribution of type 3 non-transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) revealed a broader range of strains obtained in 2020 and 2021 than in 2012. However, all the strains possessed a shared set of three genes, specifically, XopE2, XopN, and AvrBs2. Furthermore, all examined effectors were observed in the Bobo-Dioulasso region. Regarding the characterization of TALEs, two profiles containing two to three TALEs were discovered. Profile 1, consisting of two TALEs, was found in 37 Xcc strains, whereas Profile 2, comprising three TALEs, was detected in 11 strains. Among the three TALEs (A, B, and C) that were identified, TALEs B and C were present in all the strains. The correlation matrix indicated a positive association between the T3E content of strains and the duration of their isolation.

The quality of the Cu ores has decreased from 1.6% to approximately 1.0%. The proportion of As to Cu in 15% of Cu resources currently reaches 1:5. However, during the extraction and processing of Cu ores, As presents significant environmental harm. Hence, safely and effectively removing As is paramount in Cu smelting and processing, holding substantial importance in fostering environmentally sustainable practices within the Cu extraction and processing industry. This article consolidates the resource distribution of As-containing Cu (ACC) ores, comprehensively and systematically evaluates the present advancements in extracting techniques for these minerals, and identifies the challenges inherent in pyrometallurgical and wet processes for treating ACC deposits. Pyrometallurgy is a simple primary roasting technique and has widespread applicability in the treatment of various ACC minerals. Its disadvantages are the emission of exhaust gas and the high treatment costs associated with it. The wet arsenic removal method boasts advantages including minimal air pollution and a high resource recovery rate, significantly aiding in Cu concentrate recovery; its major drawback is the production of As-containing wastewater. The hydrometallurgical removal of As from ACC mines involves extracting As through leaching. Recently, biometallurgy has presented innovative solutions using specialized microorganisms to bioleach or bioabsorb As, but large-scale industrial applications still lack specific practical implementation. This review explores the underlying causes of the challenges encountered in processing ACC minerals. Additionally, it highlights pyrometallurgical roasting coupled with high-temperature filtration as a pivotal advancement in the extraction and processing of ACC ores.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["ChemEngineering"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.4081\/itjm.2024.1737","title":["Prevention is better than healing.

Nevertheless, it is not easy since we have to identify drugs effective to genes which are also critical for diseases. When starting from diseases (disease centric approach), we need to identify genes critical in diseases and find drugs effective to the selected genes. When we start from drugs (drug centric approach), we need to find genes that drugs target and then find diseases in which identified genes are critical. These are complicated processes. If we can identify genes which are effective to the disease and can be targeted by drugs, i.e. if we can start from genes (gene centric approach), it is much easier. Nevertheless, none knows how we can identify such sets of genes without specifying either target diseases or drugs. Hence, our novelty is attributed to an artificial intelligence-based approach, employing unsupervised methods and identifying such genes without specifying either diseases or drugs. To inspect the feasibility, we have applied tensor decomposition (TD) based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to perform drug repositioning from protein-protein interaction (PPI) without using any other information. Proteins selected by TD based unsupervised FE included many genes related to cancers as well as drugs that target selected proteins. Thus, we could identify drugs for cancers from only PPI. Since the selected proteins have more interaction, we replaced the selected proteins with hub proteins and found that hub proteins themselves can be used for drug repositioning.

Initially, an RNA-sequence screen of LUAD cells treated with ferroptosis inducers (FINs) reveals a significant increase in MNT expression, suggesting a potential link between MNT and ferroptosis. Overexpression of MNT in LUAD cells hinders changes associated with ferroptosis. Moreover, the upregulation of MNT promotes cell proliferation and suppresses chemotherapy sensitivity, while the knockdown of MNT has the opposite effect. Through the intersection of ChIP-Seq and ferroptosis-associated gene sets, and validation by qPCR and western blot, SAT1 is identified as a potential target of MNT. Subsequently, we demonstrate that MNT binds to the promoter sequence of SAT1 and suppresses its transcription by ChIP-qPCR and dual luciferase assays. Restoration of SAT1 levels antagonizes the efficacy of MNT to inhibit ferroptosis and chemosensitivity and promote cell growth in vitro as well as in vivo. In the clinical context, MNT expression is elevated in LUAD and is inversely connected with SAT1 expression. High MNT expression is also associated with poor patient survival.

Here, we identified markedly elevated GSDMD in human and mouse LN kidneys, predominantly in CD11b<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> myeloid cells. Global or myeloid-conditional deletion of GSDMD was shown to exacerbate systemic autoimmunity and renal injury in lupus mice with both chronic graft-versus-host (cGVH) disease and nephrotoxic serum (NTS) nephritis. Interestingly, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that myeloid GSDMD deficiency enhanced granulopoiesis at the hematopoietic sites in LN mice, exhibiting remarkable enrichment of neutrophil-related genes, significant increases in total and immature neutrophils as well as granulocyte\/macrophage progenitors (GMPs). GSDMD-deficient GMPs and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-stimulated human promyelocytes NB4 were further demonstrated to possess enhanced clonogenic and differentiation abilities compared with controls. Mechanistically, GSDMD knockdown promoted self-renewal and granulocyte differentiation by restricting calcium influx, contributing to granulopoiesis. Functionally, GSDMD deficiency led to increased pathogenic neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in lupus peripheral blood and bone marrow-derived neutrophils. Taken together, our data establish that GSDMD deletion accelerates LN development by promoting granulopoiesis in a calcium influx-regulated manner, unraveling its unrecognized critical role in LN pathogenesis.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Cell Communication and Signaling"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956652.v1","title":["Supplementary Figure S14 from Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Following Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The PETAL Phase Ib Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3529-0103","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David J.","family":"Pinato","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9164-3671","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonio","family":"D'Alessio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5654-9225","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Claudia Angela Maria","family":"Fulgenzi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5892-9224","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexandra Emilia","family":"Schlaak","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5662-2162","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ciro","family":"Celsa","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-8538-9251","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Saskia","family":"Killmer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7725-965X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jesus Miguens","family":"Blanco","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-3256-4515","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Caroline","family":"Ward","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8441-6470","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Charalampos-Vlasios","family":"Stikas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6973-3067","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mark R.","family":"Openshaw","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-7064-6601","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nicole","family":"Acuti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9764-4288","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Georgios","family":"Nteliopoulos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7927-5538","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cristina","family":"Balcells","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7358-8851","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hector C.","family":"Keun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5184-4519","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert D.","family":"Goldin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2390-1886","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul J.","family":"Ross","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1209-5735","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alessio","family":"Cortellini","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-8373-0518","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Thomas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-9040-5646","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anna-Mary","family":"Young","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5416-7971","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nathan","family":"Danckert","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-2783-8069","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Paul","family":"Tait","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7994-5239","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julian R.","family":"Marchesi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2552-740X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bertram","family":"Bengsch","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2441-549X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rohini","family":"Sharma","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S14.\nAlpha and beta diversity measures of stool samples collected at screening were compared\nwith samples collected at the end of treatment (EOT).

These toxins exhibit three natural substitutions near the C-terminal region, which is directly involved in the interaction between alpha toxins and Nav channels. Additionally, we characterized the activity of the Tst3 toxin on Nav1.1-Nav1.7 channels. The three natural changes between the toxins did not alter sensitivity to Nav1.4, maintaining similar intensities regarding their ability to alter opening probabilities, delay fast inactivation, and induce persistent currents. Computational analysis demonstrated a preference for the down conformation of VSD4 and a shift in the conformational equilibrium towards this state. This illustrates that the sequence of these toxins retained the necessary information, even with alterations in the interaction site region. Through electrophysiological and computational analyses, screening of the Tst3 toxin on sodium isoform revealed its classification as a classic \u03b1-NaTx with a broad spectrum of activity. It effectively delays fast inactivation across all tested isoforms. Structural analysis of molecular energetics at the interface of the VSD4-Tst3 complex further confirmed this effect.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Toxins"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/brainsci14060570","title":["Bridging the Gap between Psychophysiological and Audiological Factors in the Assessment of Tinnitus: An EEG Investigation in the Beta Band"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6983-0219","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Bianca Maria Serena","family":"Inguscio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9912-7006","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dario","family":"Rossi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"}]},{"given":"Giovanna","family":"Giliberto","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"}]},{"given":"Alessia","family":"Vozzi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8560-5671","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gianluca","family":"Borghini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4962-176X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fabio","family":"Babiloni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"Department of Computer Science, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou 310018, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4824-9871","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonio","family":"Greco","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Sense Organs, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8953-7610","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Giuseppe","family":"Attanasio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Head and Neck Department, Policlinico Umberto I, 00161 Rome, Italy"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1347-1306","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Giulia","family":"Cartocci","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy"},{"name":"BrainSigns Srl, 00198 Rome, Italy"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Despite substantial progress in investigating its psychophysical complexity, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma. The present study, through an ecological and multidisciplinary approach, aims to identify associations between electroencephalographic (EEG) and psycho-audiological variables. Methods: EEG beta activity, often related to stress and anxiety, was acquired from 12 tinnitus patients (TIN group) and 7 controls (CONT group) during an audio cognitive task and at rest. We also investigated psychological (SCL-90-R; STAI-Y; BFI-10) and audiological (THI; TQ12-I; Hyperacusis) variables using non-parametric statistics to assess differences and relationships between and within groups. Results: In the TIN group, frontal beta activity positively correlated with hyperacusis, parietal activity, and trait anxiety; the latter is also associated with depression in CONT. Significant differences in paranoid ideation and openness were found between groups. Conclusions: The connection between anxiety trait, beta activity in the fronto-parietal cortices and hyperacusis provides insights into brain functioning in tinnitus patients, offering quantitative descriptions for clinicians and new multidisciplinary treatment hypotheses.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Brain Sciences"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.53747\/nst.v13i4.450","title":["Characteristics of fine dust pollution PM\u2082.\u2085 in Hanoi in 2021"],"author":[{"given":"Thu Bac","family":"Vuong","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lan Anh","family":"Ha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dinh Kien","family":"Mai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Huyen Trang","family":"Nguyen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the most dangerous pollutions in the atmosphere in the Hanoi capital.

It facilitates the transport of organic cations, zwitterions, with selectivity for positively charged solutes. Ergothioneine, an antioxidant compound, and acetylcholine (Ach) are among its substrates. Given the lack of experimentally solved structures of this protein, this study aimed at generating a reliable 3D model of OCTN1 to shed light on its substrate-binding preferences and the role of sodium in substrate recognition and transport. A chimeric model was built by grafting the large extracellular loop 1 (EL1) from an AlphaFold-generated model onto a homology model. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed domain-specific mobility, with EL1 exhibiting the highest impact on overall stability. Molecular docking simulations identified cytarabine and verapamil as highest affinity ligands, consistent with their known inhibitory effects on OCTN1. Furthermore, MM\/GBSA analysis allowed the categorization of substrates into weak, good, and strong binders, with molecular weight strongly correlating with binding affinity to the recognition site. Key recognition residues, including Tyr211, Glu381, and Arg469, were identified through interaction analysis. Ach demonstrated a low interaction energy, supporting the hypothesis of its one-directional transport towards to outside of the membrane. Regarding the role of sodium, our model suggested the involvement of Glu381 in sodium binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of systems at increasing levels of Na+ concentrations revealed increased sodium occupancy around Glu381, supporting experimental data associating Na+ concentration to molecule transport. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the 3D structure of OCTN1, its substrate-binding preferences, and the role of sodium in the recognition. These findings contribute to the understanding of OCTN1 involvement in various physiological and pathological processes and may have implications for drug development and disease management.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["PLOS ONE"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1177\/13548166241257966","title":["The impact of COVID-19 on the tourism sector in Italy: A regional spatial perspective"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9301-4505","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maria Giovanna","family":"Brandano","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"}]},{"given":"Alessandra","family":"Faggian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"}]},{"given":"Adriana C","family":"Pinate","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> The recent COVID-19 pandemic crisis affected all economic sectors, but tourism was hit the hardest.

intelligent perception is proposed in this paper. This method integrates multi-source and multi-level information, including spindle temperature field, spindle thermal deformation, operating parameters, and motor current. Firstly, the internal and external thermal-error-related signals of the spindle system are collected by sensors, and the feature parameters are extracted; then, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is utilized to realize the preliminary integration of the feature parameters because of the advantages of the RBF neural network, which offers strong multi-dimensional solid nonlinear mapping ability and generalization ability. Thermal-error decision values are then generated by a weighted fusion of different pieces of evidence by considering uncertain information from multiple sources. The spindle thermal-error sensing experiment was based on the spindle system of the VMC850 (Yunnan Machine Tool Group Co., LTD, Yunnan, China) vertical machining center of the Yunnan Machine Tool Factory. Experiments were designed for thermal-error sensing of the spindle under constant speed (2000 r\/min and 4000 r\/min), standard variable speed, and stepped variable speed conditions. The experiment\u2019s results show that the prediction accuracy of the intelligent-sensing model with multi-source information fusion can reach 98.1%, 99.3%, 98.6%, and 98.8% under the above working conditions, respectively. The intelligent-perception model proposed in this paper has higher accuracy and lower residual error than the traditional BP neural network perception and wavelet neural network models.

Therefore, in this study, we proposed a streamlined framework comprising six steps: pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, clustering, shape modeling, and validation, for head shape classification and modeling. We collected 36 firefighter 3D head scans and implemented the framework. Different clustering techniques, such as k-means and k-medoids, were evaluated using the squared Euclidean distance of individual head shapes from their cluster centroid. Furthermore, five variations of NURBS and cubic spline methods were assessed to design the representative head shape of each cluster, and their accuracy was evaluated using mean square error (MSE) values. The clustering results indicated that k-means provide better metrics than k-medoids. Among the shape modeling methods, cubic spline least squares displayed the lowest MSE (0.70 cm^2)and computational time (0.14 s), whereas NURBS least squares displayed the highest MSE (7.19 cm^2). Overall, the framework with k-means clustering and cubic spline least squares modeling techniques proved to be the most efficient for small datasets.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fmats.2024.1362744","title":["MPX3 van der Waals magnets under pressure (M = Mn, Ni, V, Fe, Co, Cd; X = S, Se)"],"author":[{"given":"Takahiro","family":"Matsuoka","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Heung-Sik","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Subhasis","family":"Samanta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Janice L.","family":"Musfeldt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"David G.","family":"Mandrus","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>van der Waals antiferromagnets with chemical formula <jats:italic>M<\/jats:italic>P<jats:italic>X<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub> (<jats:italic>M<\/jats:italic> = V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd; <jats:italic>X<\/jats:italic> = S, Se) are superb platforms for exploring the fundamental properties of complex chalcogenides, revealing their structure-property relations and unraveling the physics of confinement.

Numerous methods have been developed to normalise these effects with sample and gene specific adjustments. However, in spatial transcriptomics data, normalisation is complicated by the fact that spatial region-specific library size confounds biology. The most popular approach of adapting methods developed for single-cell RNA-seq data has been shown to excessively remove biological signals associated with spatial domains and thus results in poorer downstream domain identification. To this end, we propose the first spatially-aware normalisation method, SpaNorm. SpaNorm concurrently models spatial library size effects and the underlying smooth biology, to tease apart these effects, and thereby remove library size effects without removing biology. This is achieved through optimal decomposition of spatially smooth variation into those related and unrelated to library size and the use of location-specific scaling factors. Using 27 tissue samples from 6 datasets spanning 4 spatial platforms, we show that SpaNorm outperforms current state of the art methods at retaining biological information in the form of spatial domains and spatially variable genes (SVGs) better than 4 commonly used single-cell normalisation approaches. SpaNorm is versatile and it can be used for both spot-based and subcellular spatial transcriptomics data. Notably, the benefit of using SpaNorm is more pronounced for the latter data such as those from Xenium, STOmics and CosMx platforms for which the proportion of genes exhibiting region-specific library size effect is higher. SpaNorm works equally well with segmented cell-level data and spot-based data where each spot contains multiple cells.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1017\/s0260210524000354","title":["Towards an abolitionist feminist peace: State violence, anti-militarism, and the Women, Peace and Security agenda"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0853-8660","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hannah","family":"Wright","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1019-5476","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Columba","family":"Achilleos-Sarll","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n\t  <jats:p>Ever more doubts are being raised over the \u2018transformative potential\u2019 of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda and whether it brings us closer to realising feminist peace. Underpinning a current of WPS activism and scholarship is a radical conceptualisation of feminist peace rooted in anti-militarism, anti-capitalism, and anti-imperialism. This strand shares many commonalities with abolition feminism, yet the two literatures and movements are rarely put in conversation. While both begin from similar political commitments and analyses of the international system, they propose radically different solutions for bringing about feminist liberation. Building on this observation, we ask: (1) how would abolition feminism explain why the WPS agenda has often failed to make progress towards a radical vision of feminist peace?; and, as a corollary, (2) what does abolition feminism demand of the WPS agenda? First, using the framework of \u2018reformist\u2019 and \u2018non-reformist reforms\u2019, we argue that many WPS policies are better understood as reformist rather than transformative. Second, we argue that abolitionist thinking suggests deeper critiques of WPS than those often put forward by its anti-militarist critics, based on a broader conceptualisation of militarism. Ultimately, abolition feminism demands non-reformist, anti-carceral solutions that raise challenging questions about pathways towards feminist peace.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Review of International Studies"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1101\/2024.06.01.595941","title":["In vivo ElectroChromic Shift measurements of photosynthetic activity in far-red absorbing cyanobacteria"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9262-8257","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Julien","family":"Selles","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3574-2234","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jean","family":"Alric","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3124-154X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"A.

These species have a modified photosynthetic apparatus containing red-shifted pigments. The incorporation of red-shifted pigments decreases the photochemical efficiency of photosystem I and, especially, photosystem II, and it might affect the distribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems with possible consequences on the activity of the entire electron transport chain. To investigate the in vivo effects on photosynthetic activity of these pigment changes, we present here the adaptation of a spectroscopic method, based on a physical phenomenon called ElectroChromic Shift (ECS), to the far-red absorbing cyanobacteria Acaryochloris marina and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC7203. ECS measures the electric field component of the trans-thylakoid proton motive force generated by photosynthetic electron transfer. We show that ECS can be used in these cyanobacteria to investigate in vivo the stoichiometry of photosystem I and photosystem II and their absorption cross-section, as well as the overall efficiency of light energy conversion into electron transport. Our results indicate that both species use visible and far-red light with similar efficiency, despite significant differences in their light absorption characteristics.

Hub genes were identified through protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and module construction. The ConsensuClusterPlus package was utilized to identify molecular subtypes based on hub genes. The therapeutic response, immune microenvironment, and biological pathways of subtypes were further investigated. A total of 18 DEGs were found in UC patients. We further identified <jats:italic>IFI16<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>MB21D1 (CGAS)<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>TMEM173 (STING)<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TBK1<\/jats:italic> as the hub genes. These genes are highly expressed in UC. <jats:italic>IFI16<\/jats:italic> exhibited the highest diagnostic value and predictive value for response to anti-TNF therapy. The expression level of IFI16 was higher in non-responders to anti-TNF therapy. Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on genes related to the cGAS-STING pathway revealed that patients with higher gene expression exhibited elevated immune burden and inflammation levels. This study is a pioneering analysis of cGAS-STING pathway-related genes in UC. These findings provide new insights for the diagnosis of UC and the prediction of therapeutic response.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Scientific Reports"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/pr12061152","title":["Editorial on the Special Issue \u201cNatural Compounds Applications in Drug Discovery and Development\u201d"],"author":[{"given":"Alina","family":"Bora","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"\u201cCoriolan Dragulescu\u201d Institute of Chemistry, 24 M.

Briefly, UPFs are defined as containing at least one marker of ultra\u2010processing (MUP). MUPs are (1) cosmetic additives, (2) aromas, (3) some highly processed carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and\/or fiber, and (4) drastic processes directly applied to food such as extrusion cooking or puffing. The first three categories of MUPs are on the food packaging in the list of ingredients, and are extracted, then purified, from raw foods or coming from artificial syntheses, leading to a\u2010matrix\/a\u2010cellular compounds. Therefore, the core paradigm to define MUP is <jats:italic>extreme food matrix degradation<\/jats:italic>, and for UPF, <jats:italic>matrix artificialization<\/jats:italic>.

Methodology. The article provides an overview of research into the value orientations of young people, presents a description of students\u2019 opinions about traditional values, and presents the results of an analysis of a survey of 3,000 students about patriotic values, carried out during the project \u201cStudent communities as a space for patriotic education\u201d.

Conclusion. In conclusion, the authors note that it is important for curators in their activities to think over the forms of pedagogical support for students\u02bc activities, competently build a system in the educational process that unites students of different faculties, analyze the problems of student life, monitor the dynamics of students\u02bc attitudes to what is happening, and change their value attitude.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Pedagogical Innovations"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/1078-0432.25956541","title":["Supplementary Figure S4 from Stabilizing Tumor-Resident Mast Cells Restores T-Cell Infiltration and Sensitizes Sarcomas to PD-L1 Inhibition"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6256-3250","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Myrofora","family":"Panagi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7125-4062","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fotios","family":"Mpekris","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3172-9489","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Chrysovalantis","family":"Voutouri","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2484-0074","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andreas G.","family":"Hadjigeorgiou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0003-5754-0788","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Chloe","family":"Symeonidou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0667-6952","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eleni","family":"Porfyriou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1081-6807","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christina","family":"Michael","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1641-1854","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andreas","family":"Stylianou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9828-8203","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John D.","family":"Martin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4030-2631","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Horacio","family":"Cabral","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5316-7574","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Anastasia","family":"Constantinidou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3093-1696","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Triantafyllos","family":"Stylianopoulos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;10 mg\/kg ketotifen dose is tolerable.&lt;\/p&gt;<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1038\/s44220-024-00261-x","title":["Assessing rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms across observational, experimental and medical research"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4846-2741","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tabea","family":"Schoeler","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jessie R.","family":"Baldwin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ellen","family":"Martin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wikus","family":"Barkhuizen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2557-4716","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jean-Baptiste","family":"Pingault","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Cannabis, one of the most widely used psychoactive substances worldwide, can give rise to acute cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms (CAPS).

Evidence for beneficial genes being introgressed into or selected for in hybrids raises concurrent questions about its evolutionary significance. In Darwin's tree finches on the island of Floreana (Galapagos Islands, Ecuador), the Critically Endangered medium tree finch (<jats:italic>Camarhynchus pauper<\/jats:italic>) undergoes introgression with the stable small tree finch (<jats:italic>Camarhynchus parvulus<\/jats:italic>), and hybrids regularly backcross with<jats:italic>C. parvulus<\/jats:italic>. Earlier studies in 2005-2013 documented an increase in the frequency of<jats:italic>Camarhynchus<\/jats:italic>hybridisation on Floreana using field-based and microsatellite data. With single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the same Floreana tree finches sampled in 2005 and 2013 (n = 95), we examine genome-wide divergence across parental and hybrid birds and evidence for selection in hybrids. In assessing previous estimates of introgression we found that just 18% of previously assigned hybrid birds based on microsatellites were assigned to hybrids using SNPs. Over half of the previously assigned hybrids (63%) were reassigned to<jats:italic>C. parvulus<\/jats:italic>, though parental species showed concordance with prior assignments. Of 4869 private alleles found in hybrid birds, 348 were at a high frequency (\u22650.30) that exceeded their parental species of origin 89-96% of the time. Across the two years, 3436 (70.6%) private alleles underwent a substantial (\u22650.30) allele frequency increase or decrease. Of these, 28 private alleles were identified as candidate loci under selection via local PCA genome scans and outlier tests. Alleles were annotated to genes associated with inflammation, immunity, brain function and development. We provide evidence that introgression among a critically endangered and stable species of Darwin's tree finch is being retained by selection across years and may aid in the retention of genetic diversity in birds threatened with extinction.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4404556\/v1","title":["Effectiveness of radiation shields to minimize operator dose in the bronchoscopy suite: a phantom study and clinical cases"],"author":[{"given":"Hosang","family":"Jeon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital"}]},{"given":"Dong Woon","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital"}]},{"given":"Ji Hyeon","family":"Joo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Yongkan","family":"Ki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Suk-Woong","family":"Kang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Orthopedics, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Won Chul","family":"Shin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Orthopedics, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Seong Hoon","family":"Yoon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital"}]},{"given":"Yun Seong","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Seung Hyun","family":"Yong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Hyun Sung","family":"Chung","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cancer Center"}]},{"given":"Taehoon","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Ulsan College of Medicine"}]},{"given":"Hee Yun","family":"Seol","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Background\n The purpose of this study was to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of radiation shields to minimize radiation exposure to the bronchoscopist location in a phantom study and 2) determine the dose of radiation exposure to medical staff with radiation shields in clinical cases.\nMethods\n To mimic bronchoscopic operations, an anthropomorphic torso phantom was positioned on the fluoroscopic table between the C-arm X-ray tube and the image detector. A combination of upper body lead shields and lower body lead shields was placed to examine the effectiveness of radiation shielding. Scatter radiation rates were assessed at a primary operator location using real-time dosimeters with and without the presence of protective devices.

Nonlethal removal of fin structures would also expand opportunities for collecting age-related information, specifically during small-population projects as well as tournaments and citizen-science programs, for which sacrificing fish is not an option. We assessed the bias of age estimates derived from Florida Bass anal-, pelvic-, dorsal-, and pectoral-fin rays and anal-, pelvic-, and dorsal-fin spines by comparing them to age estimates derived from otoliths (i.e., sagittae), which are the standard for ageing Florida Bass. We evaluated the precision of age estimates by calculating the absolute difference between replicate reads of each ageing structure for each reader. Linear-mixed effects model selection indicated that precision was most affected by age, structure, and the age*structure interaction, in which the effect of age varied by structure. Age estimates from otoliths were the most precise whereas pelvic spines were the least precise among all structures examined. Bias was similar across all fin structures, but the effect of age on bias varied by reader. Marginal increment analysis indicated that annulus formation was completed from November to March in Florida Bass dorsal spines, 5 months earlier than in Florida Bass otoliths. Our results suggest that nonlethally removed fin structures, especially dorsal spines, have potential for use in estimating age, growth rates, mortality, and age structure of bass populations, which could be particularly beneficial where bass can reach unusual trophy sizes.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1007\/s10462-024-10782-7","title":["An integrated group decision-making framework for assessing S3PRLPs based on MULTIMOORA-WASPAS with q-rung orthopair fuzzy information"],"author":[{"given":"Yuan","family":"Rong","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Liying","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yi","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xingdong","family":"Peng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Harish","family":"Garg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Sustainable third-party reverse logistics has gradually risen to prominence as a component of contemporary commercial development as a result of the acceleration of global economic integration and the prominent growth of information technology in the logistics industry. In the procedure of sustainable third-party reverse logistics providers (S3PRLPs) selection, indeterminacy and conflict information bring great challenges to decision experts. In view of the significant superiority of q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) set in expressing uncertain and vague assessment information, this essay designs a comprehensive assessment framework through merging the best and worst method (BWM), Multiplicative Multi-objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis with Full Multiplicative Form (MULTIMOORA) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method to address the S3PRLPs selection issue with entirely unknown weight information under q-ROF setting. Firstly, we present a novel score function for comparing q-ROF numbers after analyzing the inadequacies of previous works. Secondly, the q-ROF Frank interactive weighted average (q-ROFFIWA) and q-ROF Frank interactive weighted geometric (q-ROFFIWG) operators are advanced based on the constructed operations to take into consideration the interactive impact of information fusion procedure. Thirdly, the q-ROF-MULTIMOORA-WASPAS decision framework is built based on novel score function and the developed operators, in which the synthetic weights of the criterion are determined by the modified BWM and entropy weight method to reflect both the subjectivity of the decision expert and the objectivity of the decision information. Ultimately, an empirical example was used to evaluate S3PRLPs to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the developed methodology, and a comparative analysis was conducted with other existing methods to highlight its advantages in dealing with complex decision problems. The discussion from the research indicates that the developed methodology can be used to evaluate S3PRLPs and further improve the quality of logistics services for organizations.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Artificial Intelligence Review"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1038\/s41467-024-49200-5","title":["Potent activity of polymyxin B is associated with long-lived super-stoichiometric accumulation mediated by weak-affinity binding to lipid A"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9419-0076","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kerry R.","family":"Buchholz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mike","family":"Reichelt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Matthew C.","family":"Johnson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sarah J.","family":"Robinson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Peter A.","family":"Smith","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4758-4248","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Steven T.","family":"Rutherford","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4664-6232","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John G.","family":"Quinn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Polymyxins are gram-negative antibiotics that target lipid A, the conserved membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms underpinning polymyxin activity remain unresolved. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to kinetically interrogate interactions between polymyxins and lipid A and derive a phenomenological model. Our analyses suggest a lipid A-catalyzed, three-state mechanism for polymyxins: transient binding, membrane insertion, and super-stoichiometric cluster accumulation with a long residence time. Accumulation also occurs for brevicidine, another lipid A-targeting antibacterial molecule. Lipid A modifications that impart polymyxin resistance and a non-bactericidal polymyxin derivative exhibit binding that does not evolve into long-lived species. We propose that transient binding to lipid A permeabilizes the outer membrane and cluster accumulation enables the bactericidal activity of polymyxins. These findings could establish a blueprint for discovery of lipid A-targeting antibiotics and provide a generalizable approach to study interactions with the gram-negative outer membrane.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Nature Communications"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.47941\/ijars.1943","title":["Role of Arts and Cultural Events in Community Development and Social Cohesion"],"author":[{"given":"Lora","family":"Aol","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Purpose: This study sought to investigate the role of arts and cultural events in community development and social cohesion.\r\nMethodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology. Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive\u2019s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.\r\nFindings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to the role of arts and cultural events in community development and social cohesion. Preliminary empirical review revealed that such events acted as catalysts for economic and social revitalization, enhancing local business and infrastructure through increased foot traffic and investment. They significantly boosted social cohesion by providing a platform for diverse groups to engage and share cultural experiences, thus strengthening community ties and civic engagement. Additionally, participation in these events was linked to improved mental health and personal well-being, as they offered emotional and psychological benefits that extended from communal to individual levels. The findings highlighted the necessity for ongoing support and investment in the arts, underscoring their integral role in fostering cohesive, vibrant, and resilient communities.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Social Capital Theory, Cultural Development Theory and Urban Regeneration Theory may be used to anchor future studies on the role of arts and cultural events in community development and social cohesion. The study provided comprehensive recommendations across theoretical, practical, and policy realms. It advocated for the integration of cultural activities into theories of social capital and community dynamics, emphasizing their dual role in fostering both inclusivity and deeper social bonds. Practically, it offered guidance on making cultural events more accessible and engaging for diverse communities, while on the policy level, it pushed for increased governmental investment and the incorporation of arts into broader development strategies. The study also suggested innovative funding models, continuous program evaluation, and the use of cultural indicators to track and enhance the impact of arts on communities.

Additionally, Tafel slope values of 85 and 109 mV dec\u22121 were calculated for Fe-POM and Co-POM, respectively, during the ORR.

Herein, we revealed that TSA at a low concentration (1 \u03bcM) promoted the cisplatin-induced activation of caspase-3\/6, which, in turn, increased the level of cleaved PARP1 and degraded lamin A&amp;C, leading to more cisplatin-induced apoptosis and G2\/M phase arrest of A549 cancer cells. Both ICP-MS and ToF-SIMS measurements demonstrated a significant increase in DNA-bound platinum in A549 cells in the presence of TSA, which was attributable to TSA-induced increase in the accessibility of genomic DNA to cisplatin attacking. The global quantitative proteomics results further showed that in the presence of TSA, cisplatin activated INF signaling to upregulate STAT1 and SAMHD1 to increase cisplatin sensitivity and downregulated ICAM1 and CD44 to reduce cell migration, synergistically promoting cisplatin cytotoxicity. Furthermore, in the presence of TSA, cisplatin downregulated TFAM and SLC3A2 to enhance cisplatin-induced ferroptosis, also contributing to the promotion of cisplatin cytotoxicity. Importantly, our posttranslational modification data indicated that acetylation at H4K8 played a dominant role in promoting cisplatin cytotoxicity. These findings provide novel insights into better understanding the principle of combining chemotherapy of genotoxic drugs and HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of cancers.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Molecules"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/ijtm4020021","title":["Acute Management of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation with Intravenous Flecainide plus Oral Beta-Blockers"],"author":[{"given":"Athanasios","family":"Kartalis","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8583-9881","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dimitrios","family":"Afendoulis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Petros","family":"Voutas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Maria","family":"Moutafi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Nikolaos","family":"Papagiannis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Stefanos","family":"Garoufalis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Nikolaos","family":"Kartalis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Nikolaos","family":"Smyrnioudis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cardiology Department, Skylitseio General Hospital of Chios, 82100 Chios, Greece"}]},{"given":"Antonios","family":"Ziakas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"1st Cardiology Department, AHEPA University General Hospital, 54636 Thessaloniki, Greece"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8046-0602","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthaios","family":"Didagelos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"1st Cardiology Department, AHEPA University General Hospital, 54636 Thessaloniki, Greece"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: Intravenous (IV) flecainide is recommended for the pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods: Single-center registry, initiated in the \u201cSkylitseion\u201d General Hospital of Chios in January 2020. The main inclusion criterion was IV flecainide administration plus oral b-blocker for recent-onset AF (\u226448 h). The primary outcome was conversion to sinus rhythm at 2 h. Results: A total of 121 (73 males and 48 females, with mean age 61.4 years) consecutive, unselected patients who complied with the study protocol were included. A successful conversion to sinus rhythm at 2 h was achieved in 99 patients (success rate: 81.8%). The median conversion time was 11.7 min (varied from 3 to 23 min).

This study aims to uncover potential physiological factors contributing to low seedling emergence in edamame. We conducted comprehensive assessments on thirteen prominent edamame genotypes alongside two food-grade and two grain-type soybean genotypes, focusing on germination and emergence speed in both laboratory and field settings. Additionally, we employed single electrical conductivity tests and identified and quantified seed leachate components to distinguish among soybean types. Furthermore, using a LabField\u2122 simulation table, we examined seed emergence across a wide soil temperature range (5\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C) for edamame and other soybean types. All seeds were produced under the same environmental conditions, harvested in Fall 2020, and stored under uniform conditions to minimize quality variations. Our findings revealed minimal divergence in emergence percentages among the seventeen genotypes, with over 95% germination and emergence in laboratory conditions and over 70% emergence in the field. Nonetheless, edamame genotypes typically exhibited slower germination speeds and higher leachate exudates containing higher soluble sugars and amino acids. Seed size did not significantly impact total emergence but was negatively correlated with germination and emergence speed, although this effect could be mitigated under complex field conditions. Furthermore, this study proposed differences that distinguish edamame from other soybean types regarding ideal and base temperatures, as well as thermal time. The finds offer valuable insights into edamame establishment, potentially paving the way for supporting local edamame production in the U.S.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Plant Science"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4435381\/v1","title":["Influence of the rotational speed ratio of rollers on the three-dimensional surface rolling process"],"author":[{"given":"Tianyu","family":"Guan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bo","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Litao","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenzhi","family":"Fu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Jilin University"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Rolling technology with rigid arc rollers presents an innovative approach for the rapid manufacturing of three-dimensional surface components. This method employs a pair of rollers, each possessing a distinct curvature (convex and concave), which act as forming tools. The unique design generates a variable gap between the rollers, applying lateral bending and uneven compression to sheet metal, thus producing components with complex curvatures. Variations in the axial cross-section of the rollers lead to differential linear speeds between the surfaces of the convex and concave rollers, significantly influencing the morphology of the formed three-dimensional surface parts. Adjusting the rotational speed ratio of the rollers results in changes to the linear speed of rollers, which markedly affects the shapes of the components. Employing finite element simulation and experimental studies, this research investigates the effects of rotational speed variations on the bending deformation and dimensional accuracy of three-dimensional surface parts. The results reveal that increasing the rotational speed ratio initially enhances the longitudinal curvature of saddle-shaped parts, which then stabilizes, while the transverse curvature decreases. In spherical components, the longitudinal curvature diminishes and then stabilizes, with minor alterations in the transverse curvature. The degree to which the roller rotational speed ratio impacts curvature intensifies with increasing sheet metal compression. These findings suggest that the roll rotational speed ratio can be used as a new process parameter to enhance the curvature range and surface precision of formed parts.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4383217\/v1","title":["Analysis of temperature change mechanism and temperature rise characteristics of dry hobbing machine tool under heterogeneous energy conversion"],"author":[{"given":"Peng","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shengdi","family":"Peng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiao","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Chongqing Technology and Business University"}]},{"given":"Zhili","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Aiming at the problem of thermal deformation of dry hobbing machine, this paper focused on the study of temperature change mechanism and temperature rise characteristic.

All are executed on a high-performance Jetson Nano embedded system, specifically emphasizing SLAM-based obstacle avoidance and path planning using the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected due to their proven effectiveness in image and pattern recognition tasks.

A comparative analysis of the proposed DL models focused on enhancing vision systems for autonomous mobile robots. Several simulations and real-world trials were conducted to evaluate the performance and adaptability of these models in navigating complex environments. The proposed vision system with CNN ResNet18 achieved an average accuracy of 98.5%, a precision of 96.91%, a recall of 97%, and an F1-score of 98.5%.

However, the problem that students often face when learning a foreign language, including Arabic, is that students easily forget in remembering a number of vocabulary that has been memorized. To overcome this problem, the researcher offers a Talking Stick learning model to improve the mastery of Arabic vocabulary. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Talking Stick learning model in improving students' mastery of Arabic vocabulary. This research is a quantitative research with a type of quasi experiment approach (pseudo experiment) design the non-equivalent control group, with a sample of 27 students consisting of 14 students (control class) and 13 students (experimental class). The data collection method used was a test consisting of pre-test and post-test. The data analysis technique used was the independent sample t-test. Based on the research results obtained, the average value of the post-test in the experimental class was 90, while the control class was 60. The results of data analysis using the independent sample t-test showed that the significance value (2 tailed) was 0.000 &lt;0.05. It can be said that \u00a0is rejected and \u00a0is accepted. Based on the results of the N-Gain Score calculation, it shows that the average value of the N-Gain score for the experimental class is 0.7840, including in the high category.

Despite the growing popularity of CMR-based myocardial strain calculations, measures of complete spatiotemporal strains (i.e., three-dimensional strains over the cardiac cycle) remain elusive. Complete spatiotemporal strain calculations are primarily hampered by poor spatial resolution, with the rapid motion of the cardiac wall also challenging the reproducibility of such strains. We hypothesize that a super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) framework that leverages combined image acquisitions at multiple orientations will enhance the reproducibility of complete spatiotemporal strain estimation. Two sets of CMR acquisitions were obtained for five wild-type mice, combining short-axis scans with radial and orthogonal long-axis scans. Super-resolution reconstruction, integrated with tissue classification, was performed to generate full four-dimensional (4D) images. The resulting enhanced and full 4D images enabled complete quantification of the motion in terms of 4D myocardial strains. Additionally, the effects of SRR in improving accurate strain measurements were evaluated using an in-silico heart phantom. The SRR framework revealed near isotropic spatial resolution, high structural similarity, and minimal loss of contrast, which led to overall improvements in strain accuracy. In essence, a comprehensive methodology was generated to quantify complete and reproducible myocardial deformation, aiding in the much-needed standardization of complete spatiotemporal strain calculations.<\/jats:p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.37897\/rjn.2024.2.3","title":["Laughing gas abuse causing subacute combined spinal cord degeneration with psychiatric manifestations"],"author":[{"given":"Maria Ruxandra","family":"Docan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Fundeni Clinical Institute, Neurology Department, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mihaela Aftinia","family":"Marian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anca Adriana","family":"Arbune","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elena","family":"Marin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Adriana Octaviana","family":"Dulamea","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Fundeni Clinical Institute, Neurology Department, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"\u201cCarol Davila\u201d University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Fundeni Clinical Institute, Neurology Department, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Fundeni Clinical Institute, Neurology Department, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Fundeni Clinical Institute, Neurology Department, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"\u201cCarol Davila\u201d University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background. Nitrous oxide, a nonirritating gas commonly used as an anesthetic, is increasingly abused by the young population for its euphoric effects due to its seemingly harmless nature. However, its neurological impacts can vary in intensity and sometimes result in permanent damage. Accurate diagnosis and treatment hinge on identifying nitrous oxide use through anamnesis, clinical and paraclinical findings, as demonstrated in the following case report. Case report. A 27-year-old female with psychiatric history presented with progressive paresthesia and walking difficulty, admitting to recent nitrous oxide use, alongside other substances. Clinical examination revealed mild tetraparesis, coordination disturbances, generalized hyporeflexia, and sensory deficits. Electromyography showed severe sensory neuropathy, and spinal MRI indicated subacute combined degeneration (SCD) of the spinal cord. Laboratory tests revealed hyperhomocysteinemia and elevated methylmalonic acid levels, despite normal vitamin B12 levels. Treatment included intramuscular vitamin B12, folic acid, and neurotrophic agents, along with physical rehabilitation. Psychiatric symptoms, possibly exacerbated by nitrous oxide, complicated adherence to therapy. Conclusions. This case underscores the neurotoxic potential of nitrous oxide, particularly its disruption of cobalamin metabolism, and highlights the need for thorough patient histories to uncover substance use contributing to neurological symptoms. Despite treatment, some neurological deficits may persist, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and comprehensive care strategies.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Romanian Journal of Neurology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/genealogy8020071","title":["Critical Adoptee Standpoint: Transnational, Transracial Adoptees as Knowledge Producers"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6217-3674","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"SunAh Marie","family":"Laybourn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Sociology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Drawing on Asian adoptee-authored research, this article conceptualizes a critical adoptee standpoint.

Vitamin C; folic acid; and vitamin B1, B6, and B12 serve as co-factors necessary for the activity of desaturase enzymes that are the rate-limiting steps in the metabolism of EFAs. The altered metabolism of EFAs results in an imbalance in the production and activities of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines resulting in both hyperimmune and hypoimmune responses seen in sepsis.

Over the span of one year, from November 2020 to October 2021, there was a notable decrease in the proportion of patients requiring intravenous antibiotics. This percentage initially dropped from 23% to 12% with the implementation of the OPAT quality improvement project, and later, it reached an even lower 8%. This positive transformation not only had a positive impact on patient care but also led to significant cost savings, exceeding 2 million riyals. These savings were primarily driven by the reduction in hospitalization duration and the more efficient allocation of resources. Moreover, this improvement contributed to the avoidance of 673 patient days of hospitalization, thereby creating additional resources for more critical cases.<\/jats:p> <\/jats:sec> <jats:sec id=\"conclusion\"> <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title> <jats:p>OPAT has emerged as a pivotal component of Al Hada Armed Forces Hospital\u2019s commitment to elevating healthcare quality. This abstract offers a concise insight into the quality-driven impact of OPAT within a specific healthcare context, underlining its capacity to optimize patient care, enhance healthcare efficiency, and elevate resource allocation. Ongoing research and continuous evaluation will play a critical role in refining and expanding the OPAT program while preserving its quality-oriented perspective.<\/jats:p> <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["PATIENT SAFETY"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1158\/2159-8290.25956963","title":["Supplementary Table 1 from Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Analysis Reveals the Epigenetic Basis and Signature Transcription Factors for the Molecular Subtypes of Colorectal Cancers"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6144-8018","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Zhenyu","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3515-3333","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuqiong","family":"Hu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0001-0631","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Haoling","family":"Xie","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7236-6402","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kexuan","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1773-1876","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lu","family":"Wen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5248-7891","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wei","family":"Fu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4048-4017","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Xin","family":"Zhou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8625-7717","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fuchou","family":"Tang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Table 1.

Behaviors such as dietary composition, physical activity, obesity and smoking can all affect the body\u2019s oxidative stress levels. In order to evaluate the effects of various diets and lifestyles on the body\u2019s oxidative and antioxidant systems, an oxidative balance score was developed. To investigate whether the OBS is associated with the development of kidney stones.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Data were taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007\u20132018, followed by retrospective observational studies. The association between kidney stones and OBS was analyzed using survey-weighted logistic regression by adjusting for demographics, laboratory tests, and medical comorbidity covariates. The oxidative balance score is calculated by screening 16 nutrients and 4 lifestyle factors, including 5 prooxidants and 15 antioxidants, based on prior information about the relationship between oxidation levels in the body and nutrients or lifestyle factors.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A total of 26,786 adult participants were included in the study, of which 2,578, or 9.62%, had a history of nephrolithiasis. Weighted logistic regression analysis found an association between OBS and kidney stones. In the fully tuned model, i.e., model 3, the highest quartile array of OBS was associated with the lowest quartile array of OBS (OR\u2009=\u20090.73 (0.57, 0.92)) with the risk of kidney stone (<jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.01), and was statistically significant and remained relatively stable in each model. At the same time, the trend test in the model is also statistically significant. With the increase of OBS, the OR value of kidney stones generally tends to decrease.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>There is an inverse correlation between OBS and kidney stone disease.

This molaron state features rich physics, including a negative effective mass around unitarity and a first-order transition to the polaron state. However, these features have remained so far experimentally inaccessible. In this work we show theoretically how the molaron state can be directly prepared experimentally even in its excited states using Raman spectroscopy techniques. Initializing the system in the ultrastrong coupling limit, where the binding energy of the molaron is much larger than the Fermi energy, our protocol maps out the momentum-dependent spectral function of the molecule. Using a diagrammatic approach we furthermore show that the molecular spectral function serves as a direct precursor of the elusive Fulde-Ferell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase, which is realized for a finite density of fermionic impurity particles. Our results pave the way to a systematic understanding of how composite particles form in quantum many-body environments and provide a basis to develop new schemes for the observation of exotic phases of quantum many-body systems.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title\/>\n            <jats:supplementary-material>\n              <jats:permissions>\n                <jats:copyright-statement>Published by the American Physical Society<\/jats:copyright-statement>\n                <jats:copyright-year>2024<\/jats:copyright-year>\n              <\/jats:permissions>\n            <\/jats:supplementary-material>\n          <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Physical Review Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.61707\/skq77c82","title":["Strategic Management of Financial and Economic Security: Modern Challenges and Threats in a Hyperdynamic External Environment"],"author":[{"given":"Uliana","family":"Nikonenko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Olena","family":"Khalina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Oleh","family":"Bondaruk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yulia","family":"Nikolchuk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kateryna","family":"Ozarko","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The main purpose of the article is to increase the efficiency of strategic management of the financial and economic security of a modern enterprise in the face of new challenges and threats.

It allows to study practices which have received little attention in the literature to date, despite ensuring continuity, preventing deterioration, and valuing what already exists. Our working definition of creative preservation refers to practices of creation that prevent the decay of existing materials and ideas by updating and adapting them, or re-expressing them in another way through the exploration of their affordances. We examine four practices that reflect non-exhaustive forms of creative preservation practices: upcycling, bricolage, low-tech, and craft.

Climate envelope modeling, the predominant approach used to quantify this threat, presumes that individuals in populations respond to climate variability and change according to species-level responses inferred from spatial occurrence data\u2014such that individuals at the cool edge of a species\u2019 distribution should benefit from warming (the \u201cleading edge\u201d), whereas individuals at the warm edge should suffer (the \u201ctrailing edge\u201d). Using 1,558 tree-ring time series of an aridland pine (\n            <jats:italic>Pinus edulis<\/jats:italic>\n            ) collected at 977 locations across the species\u2019 distribution, we found that trees everywhere grow less in warmer-than-average and drier-than-average years. Ubiquitous negative temperature sensitivity indicates that individuals across the entire distribution should suffer with warming\u2014the entire distribution is a trailing edge. Species-level responses to spatial climate variation are opposite in sign to individual-scale responses to time-varying climate for approximately half the species\u2019 distribution with respect to temperature and the majority of the species\u2019 distribution with respect to precipitation. These findings, added to evidence from the literature for scale-dependent climate responses in hundreds of species, suggest that correlative, equilibrium-based range forecasts may fail to accurately represent how individuals in populations will be impacted by changing climate. A scale-dependent view of the impact of climate change on biodiversity highlights the transient risk of extinction hidden inside climate envelope forecasts and the importance of evolution in rescuing species from extinction whenever local climate variability and change exceeds individual-scale climate tolerances.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.3390\/ma17112712","title":["The Potential of Spot Size Control in Shaping the Thickness Distribution in Ultrashort Laser Deposition"],"author":[{"given":"Antonella","family":"Lorusso","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Mathematics and Physics \u201cE.

Employing a state-of-the-art Szatm\u00e1ri-type hybrid dye-excimer laser system emitting 248 nm pulses with a maximum energy of 20 mJ and duration of 600 fs, copper films were grown in the classical pulsed laser deposition geometry. The exceptionally clean temporal profile of the laser pulses yielded a femtosecond component of 4.18 \u00b1 0.19 mJ, accompanied by a 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 mJ ASE pedestal on the target surface. While varying the spot sizes, the plasma plume consistently exhibited an extremely forward-peaked distribution. Deposition rates, defined as peak thickness per number of pulses, ranged from 0.030 to 0.114 nm\/pulse, with a gradual narrowing of the thickness distribution as the spot area increased from 0.085 to 1.01 mm2 while keeping the pulse energy constant. The material distribution on the silicon substrates was characterized using the f(\u0398) = Acosk\u0398 + (1 \u2212 A)cosp\u0398 formalism, revealing exponents characterizing the forward-peaked component of the thickness profile of the film material along the axes, ranging from k = 15 up to exceptionally high values exceeding 50, as the spot area increased. Consequently, spot size control and outstanding beam quality ensured that majority of the ablated material was confined to the central region of the plume, indicating the potential of PLD (pulsed laser deposition) for highly efficient localized deposition of exotic materials.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Materials"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,3]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/ced\/llae216","title":["Penile nodules and ulcer"],"author":[{"given":"Karin","family":"Savo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Dermatology, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku , Turku , Finland"}]},{"given":"Pekka","family":"Taimen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Biomedicine and FICAN West Cancer Centre, University of Turku , 20520, Turku , Finland"},{"name":"Department of Pathology, Turku University Hospital , Turku , Finland"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6449-3076","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Niina","family":"Hieta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Dermatology, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku , Turku , Finland"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Primary amyloidosis of the penis is an uncommon variant of localised amyloidosis.

In light of these concerns, this study aims to develop novel co\u2010initiator combinations featuring CQ and amines which cannot be leached out of dental materials, enabling free radical polymerization of representative dental methacrylate resins under blue light irradiation. Our approach involved the initial design and analysis of hydrogen donors with low C\u2010H bond dissociation energy through molecular modeling. Subsequently, we incorporated copolymerizable methacrylate functional groups via chemical modification, allowing it to act as both coinitiator and copolymerization monomer to achieve low migration and leachability properties.
