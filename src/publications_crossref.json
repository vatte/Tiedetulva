The IDBO algorithm, enhanced in population initialization and convergence factors, minimizes total deformation and mass, addressing a multi-objective optimization model. The obtained optimal parameters guide the construction of a finite element model, considering additional factors like stiffness and maximum stress. The ensuing FEA produces a foundation for constructing a response surface, further optimized to refine the initial design. Through the combination of the IDBO algorithm and FEA method, the mass of the spindle is reduced from 46.582 kg obtained by the IDBO algorithm solution to 28.479 kg, a total reduction of 38.86%, while meeting design requirements such as maximum total deformation.

A piezoelectric vibration sensor is used with the FBG sensor to compare the vibration response obtained during the test. Pre-processing of raw signals is performed using a moving average filter (MAV) followed by a low pass filter to nullify the effect of noise.

This paper proposes a tourism itinerary recommendation system based on the calculation of the most optimal route between destinations using the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Later, the optimal route is defined using the shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra). Data for the algorithm came from the collaboration between the several road information and criteria weights that are determined using the analytics hierarchy process (AHP). According to the simulation, the criteria weights are 6.9%, 62.7%, 18.6%, and 11.9% for route length, traffic condition, travel time, and weather condition, respectively.

The study was conducted in a protected environment in Guaraciaba do Norte, Cear\u00e1 state, Brazil, using a randomized block experimental design with four replicates, in a 5 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement consisting of five hydrogel doses in the substrate (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 g L-1) and two strawberry cultivars (\u2018Albion\u2019 and \u2018San Andreas\u2019). Growth variables (number of leaves, crown diameter, and plant height) were evaluated at 15 and 45 days after transplanting (DAT). Gas exchanges (stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, CO2 assimilation rate, and intercellular CO2 concentration), physiological indices (intrinsic water use efficiency, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, and instantaneous water use efficiency), and thermal index were evaluated at 90 DAT.

The tailsitter guidance-control architecture consists of a trajectory planner, an outer-loop position controller, an inner-loop attitude controller, and a control allocator. The trajectory planner uses a simplified tailsitter model, with aerodynamic and wake effect considerations, to generate a set of transition trajectories with associated aerodynamic force estimates based on an optimization metric specified by a human operator (minimum time transition). The outer-loop controller then uses the aerodynamic force estimate computed by the trajectory planner as a feedforward signal alongside feedback linearization of the outer-loop dynamics for 6DOF position control. The inner-loop attitude controller is a standard nonlinear dynamic inversion control law that generates the desired pitch, roll, and yaw moments, which are then converted to the appropriate rotor speeds by the control allocator. Analytical conditions for robust stability are derived for the outer-loop position controller to guarantee performance in the presence of uncertainty in the feedforward aerodynamic force compensation. Finally, both tracking performance and stability of the control architecture are evaluated on a high-fidelity flight dynamics simulation of a quadrotor biplane tailsitter for flight missions that demand high maneuverability in transition between flight modes. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1123\/apaq.2023-0098","title":["Combined Virtual-Reality- and Gym-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Children With a Developmental Disability: Effects on Physical Activity Levels, Motor Skills, and Social Skills"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-2695-4302","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hoo Kyung","family":"Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7386-916X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jooyeon","family":"Jin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This study examined the effects of a combined virtual-reality- and gym-based physical activity (PA) program on PA levels, motor skills, and social skills of children with a developmental disability (DD).

In clinical practice, opioids are first-\nchoice analgesics, but long-term use of these drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions. Finding new, safe and effective pain relievers that are useful treatments for chronic pain is an urgent medical need. Based on accumulating evidence from numerous studies, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Some antioxidants are potentially beneficial analgesics in the clinic, but ROS-dependent pathways are completely inhibited only by scavenging ROS directly targeting cellular or subcellular sites. Unfortunately, current antioxidant treatments donot achieve this effect. Furthermore, some antioxidants interfere with physiological redox signaling pathways and fail to reverse oxidative damage. Therefore, the key upstream processes and mechanisms of ROS production that lead to chronic pain in vivo must be identified to discover potential therapeutic targets related to the pathways that control ROS production in vivo. In this review, we summarize the sites and pathways involved in analgesia based on the three main mechanisms by which ROS are generated in vivo, discuss the preclinical evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways in chronic pain, note the shortcomings of current research and highlight possible future research directions to provide new targets and evidence for the development of clinical analgesics.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Current Neuropharmacology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2174\/0113892010261502231102040149","title":["Systematic Review on Herbal Preparations for Controlling Visceral\nHypersensitivity in Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders"],"author":[{"given":"Naser-Aldin","family":"Lashgari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University,\nTehran, Iran"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research\nNetwork (USERN), Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Nazanin","family":"Momeni Roudsari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University,\nTehran, Iran"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research\nNetwork (USERN), Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Saeideh","family":"Momtaz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj,\nIran"},{"name":"Department of Pharmacology, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research, Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Faezeh","family":"Niazi Shahraki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University,\nTehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Nadia","family":"Zandi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department\nof Pharmacology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Benyamin","family":"Pazoki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department\nof Pharmacology, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Mohammad Hosein","family":"Farzaei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center,\nHealth Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran"},{"name":"Medical Biology Research Center,\nKermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran"}]},{"given":"Mehdi","family":"Ghasemi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Neurology, University of\nMassachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA 01655, USA"}]},{"given":"Mohammad","family":"Abdollahi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Toxicology and Diseases Group (TDG), Pharmaceutical\nSciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), and Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran\nUniversity of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"}]},{"given":"Amir Hossein","family":"Abdolghaffari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Toxicology &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University,\nTehran, Iran"},{"name":"Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research\nNetwork (USERN), Tehran, Iran"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Background:<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is an overreaction of the gastrointestinal\n(GI) tract to various stimuli and is characterized by hyperalgesia and\/or allodynia.

The issue may be an inherent mismatch between usual methods of data collection and analysis and the complex nature of the variables governing athlete wellness. Variables such as external load, stress, muscle soreness, and sleep quality may affect each other and wellness in a dynamic, nonlinear, way over time. In such an environment, traditional data-collection methods and statistics will fail to capture causal effects. If we are to move this area of sport science forward, a different approach is required. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Methods<\/jats:bold>:<\/jats:italic> We analyzed data from 2 different soccer teams that showed no significance between player load and wellness or among individual measures of wellness. Our analysis used methods of attractor reconstruction to examine possible causal relationships between GPS\/accelerometer-measured external training load and wellness variables. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Results<\/jats:bold>:<\/jats:italic> Our analysis showed that player self-rated stress, a component of wellness, seems a fundamental driving variable. The influence of stress is so great that stress can predict other components of athlete wellness, and, in turn, self-rated stress can be predicted by observing a player\u2019s load data. <jats:italic><jats:bold>Conclusion<\/jats:bold>:<\/jats:italic> We demonstrate the ability of nonlinear methods to identify interactions between and among variables to predict future athlete stress.

To compare the incidence, case-hospitalization rates, and vaccination rates of COVID-19 between people experiencing sheltered homelessness (PESH) and the broader community in Chicago, Illinois, and describe the impact of a whole community approach to disease mitigation during the public health emergency. <\/jats:p><jats:p> Methods. Incidence of COVID-19 among PESH was compared with community-wide incidence using case-based surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to May 11, 2023. Seven-day rolling means of COVID-19 incidence were assessed for the overall study period and for each of 6 distinct waves of COVID-19 transmission. <\/jats:p><jats:p> Results. A total of 774\u2009009 cases of COVID-19 were detected: 2579 among PESH and 771\u2009430 in the broader community. Incidence and hospitalization rates per 100\u2009000 in PESH were more than 5 times higher (99.84 vs 13.94 and 16.88 vs 2.14) than the community at large in wave 1 (March 1, 2020\u2013October 3, 2020). This difference decreased through wave 3 (March 7, 2021\u2013June 26, 2021), with PESH having a lower incidence rate per 100\u2009000 than the wider community (8.02 vs 13.03). Incidence and hospitalization of PESH rose again to rates higher than the broader community in waves 4 through 6 but never returned to wave 1 levels. Throughout the study period, COVID-19 incidence among PESH was 2.88 times higher than that of the community (70.90 vs 24.65), and hospitalization was 4.56 times higher among PESH (7.51 vs 1.65). <\/jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. Our findings suggest that whole-community approaches can minimize disparities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission between vulnerable populations and the broader community, and reinforce the benefits of a shared approach that include multiple partners when addressing public health emergencies in special populations.

Preliminary evidence suggests that subsequent disturbances in balance, motor skills, and decision-making processes could potentially increase the vulnerability to injury. An abundance of lab-based studies looked into the effects of MF on performance; however, many questions remain about the mechanisms of origin and neurophysiological causes of MF, and only small steps have been taken to translate this knowledge into practice. Thus, there is a need for more research into the underlying mechanisms of MF and the role of the brain, as well as more applied research with a high ecological validity that also takes into account the potential increased risk of injury due to MF.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1026\/2191-9186\/a000682","title":["\u201eI Have to Be Everyone for the Kids\u201c"],"author":[{"given":"Franziska","family":"Korn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institut f\u00fcr Sozialwesen,                     Universit\u00e4t Kassel, Deutschland"}]},{"given":"Manuela","family":"Westphal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Zusammenfassung: In diesem Beitrag werden anhand einer Fallfamilie aus der DFG gef\u00f6rderten qualitativ-ethnographischen Studie \u201eWandel und Dynamik famili\u00e4rer Generationsbeziehungen im Kontext von Flucht und Asyl\u201c (DyFam) erste Ergebnisse vorgestellt.

Clopidogrel reduces the risk of redeveloping ATE and delays recurrence of ATE in cats that have experienced an ATE episode. Consequently, cardiologists have recommended administering clopidogrel to cats as a primary preventative, suggesting that all cats with severe HCM be administered clopidogrel. However, clopidogrel is unpalatable in its manufactured format, making such administration problematic for many clients. Therefore, estimating the potential benefit of administration might help clinicians determine on a case-by-case basis the need to treat cats with clopidogrel. Relatively simple statistical analyses of currently available data, along with certain assumptions and extrapolations, allow such an estimation of benefit in terms of relative and absolute risk reduction conferred by clopidogrel. Using this approach, and provided certain assumptions are true, clopidogrel likely confers a reduction in risk of ATE in cats with moderate to severe HCM of approximately 3% to 4%. Given the difficulty of administering clopidogrel to cats, clinicians should weigh these relatively small potential benefits against the potential harms (difficulty of administration) and not necessarily insist that clients administer clopidogrel.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.2460\/javma.24.05.0350","title":["Mastectomy in ten mares: indications, surgical technique, complications, and long-term outcome"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0002-7854-2988","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Morgan N.","family":"Steiner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6499-0141","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Lindsey H.","family":"Boone","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University, Auburn, AL"}]},{"given":"Lyndsey","family":"Hayden","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO"}]},{"given":"Jim","family":"Schumacher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Las Cruces, NM"}]},{"given":"Carolyn E.","family":"Arnold","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Veterinary Medicine, Texas Tech University, Amarillo, TX"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>OBJECTIVE<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>To describe the indications for and surgical technique of mastectomy of mares and to describe the outcome of 10 mares that underwent mastectomy in a retrospective case series.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>ANIMALS<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>10 mares having disease of one or both mammary glands.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>CLINICAL PRESENTATION<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Medical records (1995 to 2022) from 2 university teaching hospitals were searched to identify mares that had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy.

Methods &amp; Materials A quasi-experimental study was conducted on 20 elderly women with an age range of 60 to 70 years. Participants were selected through purposive sampling and were randomly assigned to yoga and Square-Stepping groups. Both groups did exercise for 12 weeks and participated in a pre-test and post-test. The Wechsler memory test, stork test, berg balance test, and international falls efficacy scale were used to measure memory quotient, static balance, dynamic balance, and fear of falling, respectively. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was conducted to analyze the data Results The mean scores of memory quotient in the two groups after exercises were significantly higher than before exercises (F(1, 18)=32.692, P&lt;0.001, \u03b72=0.645). The mean static balance time in the yoga group was significantly higher than in the SSE group (F(1, 18)=60.755, P&lt;0.001, \u03b72=0.771). Furthermore, the mean dynamic balance score in the SSE group was significantly higher than in the yoga group (F(1, 18)=7.714, P=0.012, \u03b72=0.300). In addition, the mean square of fear of falling in the SSE group was significantly lower than in the yoga group (F(1, 18)=11.777, P=0.003, \u03b72=0.396).

An autonomous pulse catch system could be used to identify these areas. To explore the potential of such a system, seven concrete beams differentiated by their aggregate size were tested using an automated pulse and receive system. The effect of aggregate size, and pulse frequency on attenuation and wavespeed are investigated. The pulse regime consisted of narrowband pulses ranging from 30 kHz to 500 kHz. The results show that high frequency pulses experienced greater attenuation than low frequency pulses.

For the specimen containing coarse aggregate, pulse velocity was constant between 100 kHz and 500 kHz, whereas specimens containing coarse aggregate experienced frequency dependant attenuation. This testing shows the significant potential for an automated pulse and receive system, which could lead to the development of an autonomous health monitoring system.

The applied NDT are the passive acoustic emission technique (AET) and active ultrasonic measurements. In addition, linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) are applied as a reference measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly in this research, cylindrical concrete samples are subjected to monotonic and cyclic Brazilian splitting tests.

The two LVDTs are positioned at the center of the sample's front and back side. Besides passively monitoring the acoustic emissions, the AET sensors are also used to do active ultrasonic measurements. The research reports the comparison conducted on the deformations and cracks measured with the LVDTs, the damage growth identified with the AET, and the change in the ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements.

In the manufacturing of semiconductor devices this material parameter also plays an important role. During the so-called wafer testing inside a wafer prober small probe tips are pressed onto the chip surface to check its performance. To prevent damaging the chip by that, the fracture toughness and load limit of it has to be defined in a prequalification step. This paper presents a test system that imitates the wafer testing process as close as possible and uses acoustic emission to detect appearing cracks and thereby also the load limit. The frontend of the test setup consists of a modular single needle probe card which can be placed in a wafer prober. Also, the indenter properties (tip diameter, stiffness, etc.) can be adjusted to the probe used later on during productive wafer testing to ensure realistic probing conditions. A piezoelectric sensor and a full strain gauge Wheatstone bridge are implemented close to the single indenter to measure the AEs and the applied contact force respectively. The signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of both sensors are improved with an own analog amplifier module before recording them with an USB oscilloscope. A developed measurement software (LabVIEW) is used to adjust measurement parameters (trigger limit, record length, conversion factors, etc.) and automatically store and separate measurement data from different acoustic events and imprints. To evaluate the result files a second software tool (MATLAB) reads the files out and clusters the recorded events to separate crack signals from electrical and mechanical disturbances.

Over the past decade, attention has been afforded to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier, coupling global supply of renewable energy to demand regions. Ammonia\u2019s advantages as an energy carrier include its ease of liquefaction and established international transportation routes; overcoming its low reactivity, excessive production of nitrogen oxides and its toxicity remain as challenges. For energy applications, fuel delivery is a critical aspect of effective combustion in boilers, burners and engines. Due to its adaptable phase change characteristics, ammonia fuel may be injected as a liquid or vapour, each with respective advantages or disadvantages. The focus of this review concerns the characterisation of liquid ammonia fuel injection for combustion, including recent research findings from experimental and simulation studies. Liquid ammonia injection can result in the highly dynamic so-called \u2018flashing\u2019 or \u2018flash boiling\u2019 phenomena. Research findings have been drawn from other related applications such as accidental hazardous releases. Bespoke optical experimental rigs together with diagnostic techniques and two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have enabled studies of the flashing jets under various initial or final conditions, with recent work also examining ammonia spray combustion. The review concludes with an insight into future trends and requirements for liquid ammonia combustion. Reciprocating engines for marine propulsion are cited as potential early adopters of ammonia energy.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Johnson Matthey Technology Review"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1595\/205651324x17048121572464","title":["Structural and Electrochemical Characterisation of NBZFO Cobalt-Free Cathode Material for Intermediate-Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells: An Experimental Investigation"],"author":[{"given":"Lukman Ahmed","family":"Omeiza","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Integrated Technologies, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link, Gadong BE1410, Brunei Darussalam"}]},{"given":"Ukashat","family":"Mamudu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Advance Material and Energy Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link, Gadong BE1410, Brunei Darussalam"}]},{"given":"Yathavan","family":"Subramanian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Integrated Technologies, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link, Gadong BE1410, Brunei Darussalam"}]},{"given":"Anitha","family":"Dhanasekaran","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Integrated Technologies, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Jalan Tungku Link, Gadong BE1410, Brunei Darussalam"}]},{"given":"Md.

Advances in surgical devices now allow for posterolateral fusion to be completed quickly and effectively through a minimally invasive approach.

So long has the process of homemaking been that it includes constructions made by prehuman ancestors, upwards of a million years ago. Efforts towards the building of  shelters  and  the  founding  of  settlements  have  involved  lengthy  periods  of  relative  stasis,  punctuated  by  leaps  to  new  and more complex systems. The first home-bases were simple fireplaces, around which our ancestors gathered, prepared food, and made tools. During the Pleistocene, occasional vestiges of curvilinear huts are found, and during the Late Glacial period, substantial groups of houses appear on the plains of Eurasia. The transition to sedentary life was accomplished by Natufian hunter-gatherers in the Levant, near the end of the Ice Age. There followed the establishment of village life across the Middle East by Pre-Pottery Neolithic farmers in the early Holocene, and the first cities around 3,500 BCE in southern Iraq and south-western Iran.  Urban systems had spread across the globe by 3000 BCE, from China, to Peru in the Americas. The Classical cities of the Mediterranean developed regular urban grid plans in the fifth  century BCE and introduced new types of  civic amenities. In terms of complexity and size, the ancient city reached its zenith in imperial Rome. Occasionally, premodern cities such as Angkor became much larger than it in area through the establishment of low-density residential populations. New sources of energy were unleashed by the technological revolution of the nineteenth century that utterly transformed the city. In short order, they led to the mega-conurbations that currently spread over large tracts of the earth. This review considers factors of community interaction and communication that have both retarded and permitted breakthroughs in settlement strategies through time. It also examines the idea of non-verbal syntactical grammars that govern the patterning of human settlements, and the relative contributions of adventitious organic growth versus deliberate planning and retention of community ideals in settlement planning.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Big History"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1108\/medar-04-2024-2450","title":["Discerning the state of the art in Italy of voluntary disclosure on biodiversity and endemic species"],"author":[{"given":"Silvia","family":"Solimene","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniela","family":"Coluccia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Stefano","family":"Fontana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Carmela","family":"Gulluscio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alessandro","family":"Bernardo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Garry D.","family":"Carnegie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study aims to examine the extent and quality of biodiversity reporting within publicly traded companies in Italy during 2022, amidst growing calls worldwide for enhanced corporate environmental responsibility.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The study proposes a framework derived from existing biodiversity reporting literature and international guidelines on the topic.

Some phase amplification methods have attracted wide attention due to their ability to improve measurement sensitivity; nevertheless, the precision is generally restricted in phase measurement. Here, we report a novel optoelectronic hybrid oscillating fiber-optic sensor by mapping the measurand loaded on the sensing fiber to the frequency shift of the microwave signal, which is generated by an all-electric oscillating cavity with a frequency conversion pair. Two branch signals assisted in twice frequency conversion are obtained by heterodyne interference, with the sensing information scaled up by two optical comb line frequencies contained, and then, the phase difference is cumulatively enhanced in the closed feedback loop. Thanks to the introduction of the oscillating cavity, a detection limit improvement of 42\u00a0dB at a 10\u00a0Hz frequency offset can be achieved in theory with a cavity delay of 1\u00a0\u03bcs. The sensing precision depends on the cavity noise limit and is independent of the instrument and cavity delay. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out to demonstrate sensors with a sensitivity of 8.3\u00a0kHz\/ps and 22.3\u00a0kHz\/ps for a range of 50\u00a0ps, and 62\u00a0kHz\/ps and 162\u00a0kHz\/ps for a range of 6.7\u00a0ps.

The Kohat Sub-basin, which is part of the tectonically active western Kohat Fold and Thrust Belt, exhibits steep folds and faulting. Therefore, integrated geological and geophysical approaches are essential for effective reservoir characterization. In this study, machine-learning (ML) algorithms are used to enhance the resolution of a sparse data set obtained within a complex geophysical environment. As a result, high-resolution techniques are applied to effectively tackle the challenges faced in highly complex regimes. This study utilizes advanced ML algorithms, specifically the Extra Tree (ET) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifiers, to improve lithofacies prediction within the Kohat Sub-basin. Utilizing well-log data from six wells, including parameters such as gamma ray (GR), neutron porosity (NPHI), resistivity, caliper (CALI), density (RHOB), spontaneous potential, and microspherically focused log (MSFL), the ML models were trained for accurate lithofacies prediction. Red dots denote values outside of the interquartile range (IQR), while heat maps and box plots were utilized to visualize the data and find outliers. The Lumshiwal Formation\u2019s facies were divided into three categories: gas sand, wet sand, and shale, using cutoff values for the Vshale and Sw logs for each well. The agreement between measured and projected lithofacies is shown by confusion matrices. The precision with which lithofacies might be predicted by ML methods was proven through numerical experiments. With an accuracy of almost 94%, the ET classifier beat the XGB classifier. Particularly in heterogeneous reservoirs with different lithofacies, the ET classifier proved to be highly reliable, with lithofacies prediction accuracy ranging from 93 to 95%. The findings demonstrate how advanced ML techniques can enhance reservoir characterization in brownfields with little data, such as the Kohat Sub-basin.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the following two techniques to potentially improve yield: fertilizer restriction (FR) to reduce plant size and, thus, increase plant density and shoot number manipulation (SNM) to reduce shoot length and improve biomass partitioning. The FR technique involves leaching the substrate and providing only tap water for 0, 1, or 2 weeks at the start of flower initiation, whereas SNM involves pinching shoot tips 2, 3, or 4 times to produce 4, 8, or 16 shoots\/plant, respectively. This study used a full factorial treatment design for a total of nine treatments (three FR \u00d7 three SNM). Plants were flowered under 12-hour photoperiods for 8 weeks and then destructively harvested for data collection.

The SNM technique did not affect plant area, but more pinching events resulted in a decrease in reproductive shoot length (cm\/shoot) and an increase in inflorescence to trim the dry mass ratio (inflorescence:trim). Shorter shoot lengths are desirable for eliminating trellis support netting, which helps growers reduce material costs and improve labor efficiency during harvest. Increasing the inflorescence:trim may also reduce labor costs related to trimming, which comprise the largest cost of production by many growers.

However, the longer season increases fruit exposure to the invasive spotted-wing drosophila (<jats:italic>Drosophila suzukii<\/jats:italic>; SWD), which threatens the production of small fruits and berries, particularly in organic systems. Numerous pest management tactics have been developed for SWD in recent years; however, relatively few studies have investigated the impact of SWD on DNS. Organic DNS growers need information regarding which management strategy is most effective when compared directly. To address this knowledge gap, we established a 2-year controlled field experiment with organic DNS. We applied treatments that correspond with techniques that local growers reported using or that have shown promise for organic raspberries, including increased harvest frequency, botanical-based repellents, and weekly rotations of organic insecticides, which we compared with an untreated control. We hypothesized that noninsecticidal SWD management strategies would result in fewer SWD eggs per berry and a lower proportion of infested berries compared with those associated with an untreated control. We also hypothesized that noninsecticidal management strategies would be as effective and cost less than organic insecticide applications. We collected data regarding labor hours, direct costs, strawberry yield, and SWD infestation in experimental plots on certified organic land in Minnesota in 2022 and 2023. An average of 33% of strawberries contained SWD eggs. The experimental treatments showed inconsistent effectiveness for reducing infestation compared with that of the untreated control plots and had no effect on marketable plant yield over the 2-year period. Thus, the added labor expense of these pest control treatments yielded net returns that were 17% to 21% below the control. Labor-saving alternatives like exclusion netting or postharvest cold treatments, which reduce fruit pest exposure and egg viability without harming nontarget insects, may offer more cost-effective solutions for managing SWD in organic DNS.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["HortTechnology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1257\/app.20220645","title":["Independent Media, Propaganda, and Religiosity: Evidence from Poland"],"author":[{"given":"Irena","family":"Grosfeld","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Paris School of Economics (email: )"}]},{"given":"Etienne","family":"Madinier","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Paris School of Economics (email: )"}]},{"given":"Seyhun Orcan","family":"Sakalli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"King's Business School, King's College London (email: )"}]},{"given":"Ekaterina","family":"Zhuravskaya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Paris School of Economics and CEPR (email: )"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Exploring a drastic change in media landscape in Poland, we show that mainstream media can significantly affect religious participation.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of age-EASIX in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in South Korea.Methods: Secondary analysis was performed using clinical data retrospectively collected from 22 nationwide hospitals in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

Data was collected through semi-structured one-on-one interviews, with participants chosen via purposeful sampling. Qualitative analysis was done via a systematic process for phenomenological inquiry, with interviews thematically coded separately by 2 independent reviewers and checked for consistency.\nResults: 4 main thematic concepts were identified: \u201cprofessional, but also personal\u201d, \u201crespect and hierarchy\u201d, \u201charmony and avoidance of open conflict\u201d and the \u201cimportance of trust and establishing a familial relationship\u201d. Mentors also highlighted the value of structure in Asian mentoring relationships. \nConclusion: Cultural factors, which are deeply rooted in social norms and values, play an important role in shaping mentoring relationships in an Asian context. Mentoring programs should be tailored to leverage on the unique cultural norms and values of the region in order to promote career growth and personal development of trainees and mentors.\n\nKeywords:\tMedical Education, Graduate Medical Education, Professional Development<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Asia Pacific Scholar"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.3828\/mb.2024.22","title":["Fractals and the World Religions Paradigm"],"author":[{"given":"Perry","family":"Schmidt-Leukel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Perry Schmidt-Leukel is Senior Professor of Religious Studies and Intercultural Theology at the University of Muenster, Germany.

At the same time, however, there has been a parallel political development affecting hybrid and authoritarian regimes that has been more consequential yet largely neglected. Identified in this essay as dictatorial drift, this process implies the transition from \"soft\" forms of authoritarian rule to hardcore authoritarian policies, characterized by the emergence of unconstrained leaders with dictatorial ambitions; an extreme concentration of executive power; the marginalization of parliaments and the elimination of political opposition; the end of competitive elections; a takeover or destruction of the judiciary, independent media, and autonomous civil society organizations; and worsening political repressions. This essay documents such drift as a global phenomenon and probes its causes and consequences.

Objectives: There is no official reports in Morocco about the subtypes of aMPV circulating. Hence, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) subtypes-specific A and B, we aimed at detecting and identifying the potential subtype(s) circulating.  Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study on three broiler flocks that were strictly not vaccinated against aMPV and were located in two different geographical regions. We studied two flocks that expressed typical swollen head syndrome (SHS) and sampled them once. Furthermore, we sampled dead birds of one flock confirmed seropositive from a previous study. A total of 118 swabs pooled in 24 samples were subjected to RNA extraction and amplified using a triplex RT-PCR for specific detection of aMPV subtypes A and B. Additionally, serum samples were taken at slaughtering age to cross-check the molecular results. A total of 84 sera were analyzed with a commercial indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to detect and titer antibodies against the two subtypes. Results: Avian metapneumovirus was detected by qRT-PCR in all flocks. About 87.50% of the samples were positive for aMPV-B, and 16.67% for aMPV-A and aMPV-B simultaneously. All flocks showed seropositivity, confirming the molecular findings.

However, all is not well in paradise. Contractors often bear too heavy a burden, and still some judges seem to expect workers to go around replacing heavy machinery for a soft brush. Some legal systems draw the line on the absence of physical loss, but the technicality of owning a few grams of copper should not make too much of a difference. On the other hand, big factories should not be fully compensated.In this article it is argued that tort law should consider the role of several players: (1) a business that relies excessively on a single unprotected line of supply should not recover its disproportionate loss; (2) but a small home consumer should be entitled to recover all of his direct loss; (3) additionally, all ducts should be properly protected by whomever is responsible for laying them and by whomever is thereafter charged with maintenance; (4) moreover, comprehensive and trustworthy location maps of the network layouts should be centrally organized, updated and made easily available; (5) lastly, if all of the above entities do their fair share in avoiding loss, and contractors still manage to create havoc, then of course they should be held liable.The solution advocated for is consistent with causality considerations, the principles of fault, of proportionality, of cheapest avoider, and of cheapest insurer. It thwarts arbitrary surprises for the Defendant and sets the right incentives for everyone to prevent accidents. The legal reasoning includes, amongst other, the premise that damages owed by a third party in negligence should not be greater than those owed by a utility supplier for a full breach of contract. Suppliers hardly ever pay for the disproportionate loss of a large business, nor should they, as the grand loss of a single business ought not to be reflected in everybody\u2019s price of utilities. This would be an unfair externalization, or a free insurance, paid by many to the benefit of a few.R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Lorsque les affaires de rupture de c\u00e2bles sont apparues comme un nouveau probl\u00e8me au 20e si\u00e8cle, la plupart des syst\u00e8mes juridiques se sont content\u00e9s d\u2019une solution \u2018suffisante\u2019. Cependant, tout n\u2019est pas rose au paradis. L\u2019industrie de la construction porte souvent un fardeau trop lourd et les juges semblent presque exiger, comme crit\u00e8re de diligence, que des pinceaux soient utilis\u00e9s dans les travaux de genie civil au lieu de machines lourdes. Certains syst\u00e8mes juridiques se basent sur les dommages mat\u00e9riels physiques, mais le simple droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de quelques grammes de cuivre ne devrait pas faire de diff\u00e9rence excessive. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le manque \u00e0 gagner des grandes usines ne devrait pas non plus \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement indemnis\u00e9.Dans cet article, il est soutenu que le droit de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile devrait prendre en compte le r\u00f4le de plusieurs acteurs: (1) une entreprise qui d\u00e9pend excessivement d\u2019une seule ligne d\u2019approvisionnement non prot\u00e9g\u00e9e ne devrait pas r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ses pertes disproportionn\u00e9es; (2) mais un petit consommateur domestique devrait avoir le droit de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer toutes ses pertes directes; (3) en outre, tous les conduits devraient \u00eatre correctement prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par ceux qui sont charg\u00e9s de les poser et puis de les entretenir; (4) en outre, des cartes de localisation compl\u00e8tes et fiables de la configuration du r\u00e9seau devraient \u00eatre \u00e9tablies de mani\u00e8re centralis\u00e9e, mises \u00e0 jour et rendues facilement accessibles; (5) enfin, si toutes les entit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es font leur part pour \u00e9viter les pertes et que les entrepreneurs de construction parviennent malgr\u00e9 tout \u00e0 causer des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, ils doivent \u00eatre tenus pour responsables.Cette solution pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e est conforme aux consid\u00e9rations de causalit\u00e9, aux principes de la faute, de la proportionnalit\u00e9, du concept du cheapest avoider et de la meilleure assurabilit\u00e9. En outre, elle minimise la disproportion et le caract\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire pour l\u2019auteur du dommage et cr\u00e9\u00e9 des incitations g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus efficaces pour la pr\u00e9vention des accidents. Le raisonnement juridique repose, entre autres, sur le principe selon lequel les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dus par un tiers pour n\u00e9gligence ne devraient pas \u00eatre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux dus par un fournisseur de services publics pour une rupture totale de contrat. En effet, les fournisseurs sont rarement responsables des pertes de b\u00e9n\u00e9fices disproportionn\u00e9es des grandes entreprises, \u00e0 juste titre, car r\u00e9percuter les dommages industriels sur le prix g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019approvisionnement ne serait pas \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une externalisation injuste, ou d\u2019une assurance gratuite, pay\u00e9e par beaucoup au profit de quelques-uns.Zusammenfassung: Nachdem Kabelbruchf\u00e4lle im 20. Jahrhundert als neues Problem erschienen, haben sich viele Rechtsordnungen mit einer L\u00f6sung abgefunden die \u201egut genug\u201c schien. Aber nicht alles ist jetzt in bester Ordnung. Die Bauindustrie haftet zu sehr und Richter scheinen als Sorgfaltsma\u00dfstab fast zu verlangen, dass im Tiefbau nur noch Pinsel statt Schwermaschinen eingesetzt werden. Manche Rechtsordnungen stellen auf physischen Sachschaden ab, wobei allein das Eigentum von ein paar Gramm Kupfer nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Unterschied machen sollte. Andererseits soll der entgangene Gewinn von gro\u00dfen Fabriken auch nicht voll entsch\u00e4digt werden.In diesem Artikel wird vorgeschlagen, dass die Rolle vonmehreren Akteuren ber\u00fccksichtigt wird: (1) Gro\u00dfabnehmer sollen ihre Produktionsf\u00e4higkeit nicht allzu sehr einer vulnerablen Leitung aussetzen; (2) einem kleinen Privatverbraucher soll Entsch\u00e4digungsanspruch auf direkte Sch\u00e4den nicht verweigert werden; (3) andererseits m\u00fcssen Leitungsleger und -betreiber f\u00fcr ad\u00e4quaten Schutz der Infrastruktur sorgen und (4) auch ist es wichtig, dass zentralisierte, zuverl\u00e4ssige Lagepl\u00e4ne zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Unter diesen Voraussetzungen sollen dann auch (5) Bauarbeiter entsprechend f\u00fcr ihre Unachtsamkeit haften.Diese Abgrenzungsans\u00e4tze sind mit Kausalit\u00e4tserw\u00e4gungen, Verschuldensprinzip, Mitverschulden, dem Konzept des cheapest avoider und der besseren Versicherbarkeit zu begr\u00fcnden. Zudem minimieren sie Unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeit und Zuf\u00e4lligkeit f\u00fcr den Sch\u00e4diger und setzen allgemein effizientere Anreize zur Schadenspr\u00e4vention. Es gilt die Pr\u00e4misse, dass ein fahrl\u00e4ssiger Dritter nicht mehr aus Delikt haften soll als der Versorger aus Vertragsbruch. In der Tat haften Versorger kaum f\u00fcr unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig gro\u00dfe Gewinnausf\u00e4lle von Gro\u00dfunternehmen. Zurecht, denn die Abw\u00e4lzung von Industriesch\u00e4den auf den allgemeinen Versorgungspreis w\u00e4re unausgewogen.Resumen: En el siglo XX, cuando surgieron los litigios conocidos como \u2018cable cases\u2019, por interrupci\u00f3n de servicio debido al da\u00f1o en una conducci\u00f3n de suministro el\u00e9ctrico, de gas o agua, la mayor\u00eda de los sistemas jur\u00eddicos acabaron por conformarse con una soluci\u00f3n lo \u2018suficientemente buena\u2019. Sin embargo, la soluci\u00f3n no es satisfactoria. Los contratistas a menudo soportan obligaciones excesivas, y aun as\u00ed parece que algunos jueces esperan que los operarios sustituyan la maquinaria pesada por pinceles finos. Algunos sistemas jur\u00eddicos ponen el l\u00edmite de responsabilidad en la ausencia de p\u00e9rdidas materiales, pero el detalle de ser propietario de unos pocos gramos de cobre no deber\u00eda significar una diferencia tan grande. Por otro lado, las f\u00e1bricas no deben ser compensadas en su totalidad.En el presente art\u00edculo se argumenta que la Responsabilidad Civil debe considerar el rol de diversos actores: (1) una empresa que decide depender excesivamente de una \u00fanica l\u00ednea de suministro desprotegida no deber\u00eda recuperar unas p\u00e9rdidas desproporcionadas; (2) sin embargo, un peque\u00f1o consumidor dom\u00e9stico deber\u00eda tener derecho a recuperar la totalidad de sus p\u00e9rdidas directas; (3) adem\u00e1s, todas las conducciones deber\u00edan estar correctamente protegidas por los responsables de su instalaci\u00f3n y por quienes posteriormente se encarguen de su mantenimiento; (4) as\u00ed mismo, deber\u00edan organizarse, actualizarse y ponerse f\u00e1cilmente a disposici\u00f3n de forma centralizada mapas de ubicaci\u00f3n completos y fiables de los dise\u00f1os de la red; (5) por \u00faltimo, si todas las entidades anteriormente referidas cumplen su parte para evitar p\u00e9rdidas, y aun as\u00ed los contratistas logran causar estragos, por supuesto, deber\u00e1n responder por los da\u00f1os.La soluci\u00f3n defendida es congruente con las consideraciones de causalidad, con los principios de culpa y de proporcionalidad, y con los conceptos de \u2018cheapest cost avoider\u2019 y \u2018cheapest insurer\u2019. Evita sorpresas arbitrarias para el demandado y establece los incentivos adecuados para impulsar la prevenci\u00f3n de accidentes por parte de todos. El razonamiento jur\u00eddico incluye, entre otras, la premisa de que los da\u00f1os imputados a un tercero por negligencia no deben ser mayores que aquellos imputados a un proveedor de servicios p\u00fablicos por un incumplimiento total de contrato. Los proveedores casi nunca pagan por las p\u00e9rdidas desproporcionadas de una gran empresa, ni tienen porqu\u00e9 hacerlo, ya que las grandes p\u00e9rdidas de una sola empresa no deben reflejarse en el precio que todos pagamos por los servicios b\u00e1sicos. Eso ser\u00eda una externalizaci\u00f3n injusta, o un seguro gratuito, pagado por la mayor\u00eda para beneficio de unos pocos.<\/jats:italic>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["European Review of Private Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1353\/jod.2024.a937741","title":["China and the Battle for the Global South"],"author":[{"given":"Zoltan","family":"Barany","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> ABSTRACT: Notwithstanding the dominant narrative of Beijing's takeover of fragile democracies, it is possible to resist Chinese autocratization while also reaping benefits from its development aid.

This substance, which is also found in the natural structure of the organism, is used in many areas, from industry to household materials, from the production of coatings in dentistry to the fixation of cadavers in laboratories. Formaldehyde is commonly used in laboratories to fix tissues.  Objectives: In this study, the staining properties of tissues fixed with date molasses, a natural sugar, using the May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining method were compared with the staining properties of tissues fixed with buffered formol-saline. Methods: Liver, spleen, kidney, skin, testicle, small intestine, large intestine, brain, cerebellum, and lung tissue samples of 4 rats of both genders were used as materials in the study. Each tissue underwent routine histological tissue tracing and was stained with MGG. Results: When all tissues were evaluated anatomically, the general morphology of the tissues showed that the tissue integrity was preserved. There was no color change in the tissues. In addition, tissue hardness was at the required level, supporting previous studies. Histologically, regarding chromatin distribution, nucleus separation and cytoplasm staining, tissues fixed with date molasses and tissues fixed with buffered formal saline showed similar properties, except for the tissues subjected to intense maceration (skin and small intestines). Pale staining was observed in some tissues fixed with buffered formal saline (liver, skin, heart), but the nucleus and cytoplasm structures were better distinguished at higher magnifications. Considering the chromatin distribution, nuclear separation and cytoplasm staining in other tissues (spleen, kidney, testicle, large intestine, brain, cerebellum and lung), tissues fixed with date molasses showed similar properties to tissues fixed with buffered formal-saline. Conclusion: We recommend that researchers interested in the subject prolong the fixation period (6 months) and compare these results with those of tissues fixed for 24 hours.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Iranian Journal of Veterinary Medicine"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.22199\/issn.0717-6279-6222","title":["On gr-n-submodules of graded modules over graded commutative rings"],"author":[{"given":"Mariam","family":"Al-Azaizeh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6082-4480","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Khaldoun Falah","family":"Al-Zoubi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Let G be a group with identity e.

It is unknown whether these three proteins assemble into a static \u201cInversin complex\u201d or one that adopts multiple bioactive forms. Through the characterization of hyperactive alleles in C. elegans, we discovered that the Inversin complex is activated by dimerization. Genome engineering of an RFP tag onto the nematode homologues of INVS (MLT-4) and NEK8 (NEKL-2) induced a gain-of-function, cyst-like phenotype that was suppressed by monomerization of the fluorescent tag. Stimulated dimerization of MLT-4 or NEKL-2 using optogenetics was sufficient to recapitulate the phenotype of a constitutively active Inversin complex. Further, dimerization of NEKL-2 bypassed a lethal MLT-4 mutant, demonstrating that the dimeric form is required for function. We propose that dynamic switching between at least two functionally distinct states \u2013 an active dimer and an inactive monomer \u2013 gates the output of the Inversin complex.

PFF-DART combines the PFF and the two-step ensemble filtering algorithm in the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), exploiting the highly parallel structure of DART. To evaluate the performance of PFF-DART, we conduct an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in a simplified atmospheric general circulation model and compare the performance of PFF-DART with an existing linear and Gaussian DA method. Using the PFF-DART algorithm, we demonstrate, for the first time, the capability of the PFF to yield stable results in a yearlong cycling DA OSSE. Moreover, PFF-DART retains the important ability of the PFF to improve the assimilation of nonlinear and non-Gaussian observations. Finally, we emphasize that PFF-DART is a versatile algorithm that can be integrated with numerous other non-Gaussian DA techniques.

We have demonstrated, for the first time, that the particle flow filter runs efficiently for a yearlong experiment in an atmospheric model. The new algorithm also improves the results over a commonly used data assimilation method.

We systematically reviewed the available evidence from inception to May 2023 regarding immunosuppression protocols used in patients undergoing LT for cholangiocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors (NET), hepatic-endothelial hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) and colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), to identify common practices and to evaluate their association with oncological outcomes. Studies not involving humans, case reports and short case series (i.e., n &lt; 10) were excluded. Among 3,374 screened references, we included 117 studies involving 6,797 patients distributed as follows: cholangiocarcinoma (58.1%), NETs (18.8%), HEHE (7.7%), CRLM (6.8%), mixed neoplasms (6.8%) or others (1.7%). Only 41% of the studies disclosed details of the immunosuppression protocol, and 20.8% of studies provided drug trough concentrations during follow-up. The immunosuppression protocols described were heterogeneous and broadly mirrored routine practices for non-tumoral indications. The only exception was CRLM where tacrolimus minimization -or even withdrawal- in combination with inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORi) were consistently reported. None of the studies evaluated the relationship between the immunosuppression protocol and oncological outcomes. In conclusion, based on low-quality and indirect scientific evidence, patients with tumoral indications for LT should receive the lowest tacrolimus level tolerated under close surveillance. The combination with mTORi titrated to achieve the top therapeutic range of trough concentrations could allow complete tacrolimus withdrawal. This approach may be particularly useful in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and CRLM, in whom tumor recurrence is the main cause of death.

The rule of law, pluralism, democracy, civil society are universal values of contemporary political thought and practice and can be found normatively expressed in international documents, but also in the Romanian Constitution. Starting from the specialised doctrine and jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court of Romania in the matter, this article analyses the attributes of the Romanian state enshrined by the Constitution, respectively: rule of law; welfare state; pluralistic state; democratic state. In this study, a special attention is dedicated to the rule of law, considering the dangers that threaten it in the current period. Legislative inflation, superficial legislation, increasing the role of the Executive in the field of legislation at the expense of Parliament, the intrusions of politicians into the sphere of judicial power are just some of the dysfunctions of the Romanian rule of law. In this context, this article highlights the essential role of the Constitutional Court in guaranteeing and respecting the requirements of the rule of law. Through its jurisprudence, an important contribution is made not only in the correct interpretation and application of constitutional norms, but also in their elaboration. Under the influence of the specific socio-political factors in each country, the pressures of the Union and international law, the rule of law cannot reach perfection, but it remains a fundamental constitutional necessity whose primary purpose is to ensure the rights and freedoms of citizens.

The resulting workflow, which relies on AI and ML, generated a 2.2% uplift in production at the more than 1,300 wells where it was deployed, without requiring changes to surface or downhole equipment or generating additional work for personnel.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Derek Burmaster, production optimization engineer for ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions, said during SPE\u2019s Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition (ALCE) in August that one of the big benefits of applying the closed-loop iterative well-by-well gas lift optimization workflow is that it removes the need for an engineer or specialist to have to go into the field repeatedly to change injection rates and analyze the well\u2019s data.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\u201cFor each well, that might take a few hours, at least,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this on hundreds and hundreds of wells, and it happens every month without anybody, any manpower, or anything. So that\u2019s one of the huge benefits of doing this in a data-driven manner.\u201d<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Gas lift is so robust that it can be challenging to diagnose if the system is operating in a suboptimal state, the paper noted. Changes in a well\u2019s water cut or productivity can cause a previously optimized system to lose efficiency, which may not otherwise be known for years.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>ExxonMobil was seeking a method to optimize gas lift that would continuously monitor the state of the system and respond immediately. The resulting closed-loop software iteratively performs multirate tests, analyzes the results, and remotely implements set-point changes to optimize the wells.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\u201cThe optimization process is most effective in an iterative form, in which each multirate test produces a model that suggests a given change,\u201d the paper stated. While each model produces its own optimal injection rate, subsequent models may point to the same injection rate, and thus changes are not always made, Burmaster noted.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Even if an initially suggested set point is not optimal, it will \u201cpush the well in the right direction,\u201d which improves the starting point for the next test and helps the well reach an optimal set point over the course of a few iterations, according to the paper.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The workflow was tested in two different stages, with the first 3-month stage requiring manual approval of the recommended set points.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Journal of Petroleum Technology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.2118\/1024-0085-jpt","title":["Fiber-Reinforced Thermoplastic Sucker Rods Provide Artificial Lift Efficiencies"],"author":[{"given":"Chris","family":"Carpenter","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"JPT Technology Editor"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>_<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper IPTC 23949, \u201cFiber-Reinforced Thermoplastic Sucker Rods Providing High-Strength, Lightweight, Low-Cost, and Environmentally Responsible Artificial Lift Efficiencies,\u201d by Jeff Saponja, SPE, Oilify, and Corbin Coyes, SPE, and Michael Conner, SPE, Q2 Artificial Lift Services.

A unique feature of an FRTP composite rod is its remarkably high shear failure resistance compared with that of a thermoset composite rod. A high shear-failure resistance means the rods have compressional loading tolerance and that an entire sucker rod string could be comprised of FRTP sucker rods.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Sucker rods made from steel are relatively heavy. Extensive well-specific designs require tapering of rod strings to optimize the overall sucker rod string weight relative to the strength and fatigue requirements and consideration of the dynamic loadings from accelerations and decelerations of the rods and fluids, frictional effects, and structural or power limitations of the pump jack or unit at surface.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Steels suffer from corrosion risks. Corrosion, which rapidly can accelerate fatigue failure, often is the root cause of sucker rod failure. Fiber-reinforced composites (i.e., fibers surrounded by or wetted by a resin matrix) have gained considerable popularity because they can be tailored to have outstanding mechanical, thermal, and physical properties, and have superior material mechanical properties to metal. The fatigue behavior of composite materials and structures is complex because composites fail by a series of, or collection of, damage mechanisms, including fiber breakage, matrix cracking, fiber\/matrix debonding, delamination, and the effect of shear-induced damage on cracks. Cracking can be slowed somewhat if the reinforced fibers are of high stiffness.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Composite materials can offer a lower environmental footprint over their entire life cycle. They can require less energy to manufacture, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. A high strength\/weight ratio offers less energy consumption during operational use, further reducing CO2 emissions. Composite materials can be recycled and reused.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Composite sucker rods, in the form of thermoset fiberglass sucker rods, have offered a high strength\/weight ratio with greater corrosion tolerance, but they are too stretchy from a low glass fiber tensile modulus of elasticity for deep high-rate rod pumping and when a high production-rate decline is likely. This limitation results in a large bottomhole pump-stroke variability as operating conditions change. Such rods have low tolerance to compressional and impact loads, forcing a larger proportion of a sucker string to remain as steel. They are also more costly than steel rods.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>For sucker rod pumping, an ideal composite rod should tolerate compressional loads and feature high impact resistance and high fatigue endurance with an ability to limit or control crack formation. A composite material that potentially offers these important sucker rod properties is FRTP.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Journal of Petroleum Technology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.2118\/1024-0004-jpt","title":["President\u2019s Column: SPE@Energy Transition"],"author":[{"given":"Olivier","family":"Houz\u00e9","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"2025 SPE President"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>_<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Editor\u2019s Note: This is a summary of the October episode of the President\u2019s vodcast.

SPE\u2019s polarized views on energy transition<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>As I mentioned last month, there are significant geographic contrasts within our industry and SPE regarding how the energy transition is perceived and developed. In some SPE venues and regions, energy transition is the dominant, if not the only subject, and the P in SPE is indeed a major obstacle for support, even from our traditional stakeholders.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In other regions, stakeholders acknowledge the energy transition, but the situation is essentially business as usual. Major investments are underway to sustain production at current levels or even increase hydrocarbon production to record levels, with development plans spanning over several decades. Even in these regions, most, if not all, new projects are designed from the outset to have a low carbon footprint, including mitigating methane emissions. Energy transition is somehow factored in.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>So, there are very different narratives, which are reflected in a polite but real polarization within SPE\u2014geographic and, occasionally, demographic. As an SPE President visiting many sections and stakeholders, the contrast is often striking.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>But we are engineers operating on the same planet, and there must be a single energy narrative that accounts for the reality of the energy transition in whatever form or definition this takes, locally or globally. To do this, we can try to assess in the most objective way possible how our license to operate may evolve in the short to medium term.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>I will start with something you may have seen many times: the three main energy transition scenarios presented by the International Energy Agency (IEA).<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>These scenarios predict the climate impact by the end of the century based on current and predicted variables, including consumption, population, economics, and technologies.

They also can contribute to better planning and definitions in future well completions, resulting in increased reliability for this method of artificial lift.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Failure-Analysis Procedure<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Usually, GLV failures are detected in tubing-integrity tests. Every time a leak rate above the limits for surface-controlled subsurface safety valves is registered in such an integrity test, a procedure is performed to try to restore the sealing capacity of the GLV by flushing the valve with diesel. Then, another tubing integrity test is performed.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>When removing a supposedly failed GLV from a well, special care must be taken at the rig to preserve the equipment, retaining its condition inside the well as much as possible. For this reason, the following recommendations are prescribed:<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>- The GLV, and any material adhered to any part of its body, must not be washed.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>- If parts of the valve, debris, or any material adhered to the valve detach from its body, they shall be collected, placed inside clean plastic bags, and shipped along with the valve for failure analysis.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>- Equipment packaging requires placement in a proper box for transportation after bubble-wrapping the valve\u2019s body and detached parts.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>- Equipment storage and transportation shall preserve its original conditions.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>- Mechanical shocks must be avoided.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The failure analysis itself occurs at the valve\u2019s manufacturing shop and must be witnessed by at least two specialists from the operator. A database on GLV failures is kept and provides statistical data and general information on these incidents.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This procedure constantly has been subject to changes as new lessons learned point to the incorporation of improvements. For instance, the requisite for not cleaning the GLV at the rig came after observing that deposits could have been removed in the process. Also, more recently, some questions have been raised regarding the execution of the leakage test at the beginning of the inspection at the shop, because such tests could interfere with the position of the GLV\u2019s internals or displace or disarray any deposited material. Thus, this step has been discontinued unless a good reason exists to suppose that the valve internal seals are functional.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Failure-Analysis Excerpts<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The complete paper presents seven cases of failure analysis (four are included in this synopsis) for GLVs retrieved from subsea wells in recent years, accompanied by a short description of the facts of the case.

A reservoir simulation study was conducted, and the expected performance of AICV was compared with other AICD technologies installed in the field, indicating potential benefits related to better reservoir management.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Field Description<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Breta\u00f1a Norte is an onshore field in the Peruvian Amazon. The Vivian formation is the main reservoir of the Breta\u00f1a Norte field and consists entirely of fluvial deposits composed of massive, moderately sorted, fluvial sandstones with thicknesses ranging from 40 to 200 ft. The Vivian formation is subdivided into Vivian S1 and Vivian S2, but only the Vivian S2 formation has been exploited to date. Heavy oil is produced from the Vivian S2 formation (18\u201319 \u00b0API and 25 cp), which features reservoir permeability ranging from 1 to 4 darcies.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An active bottom aquifer of greater than 400-ft thickness was encountered under the60-ft oil column of the reservoir, posing a difficult production challenge to the operator: how to handle high volumes of water production that must be reinjected into a different formation.<\/jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The Breta\u00f1a Norte field began production in 2018 with a few initial deviated wells with electrical submersible pumps (ESPs).

Between 2019 and 2023, 11 wells were completed with different AICD technologies. Even though initial results were positive, such outcomes have been highly dependent on the structural position of the wells. In 2022, a trial well was completed with the AICV technology in the flank of the reservoir, significantly closer to the oil\/water contact (OWC), to evaluate its performance under challenging conditions.<\/jats:p>\n               <\/jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>AICV Technology<\/jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The AICV is an AICD designed to modify its open-flow area according to the properties (viscosity and density) of the fluids flowing through it and to choke flow progressively as water cut or gas-volume fraction values increase.

The AICV consists of two flow paths, the main flow path and the pilot flow path, with an approximate flow distribution of 97 and 3%, respectively.

A total of 40 ground water samples were collected from dug wells, tube wells, and hand pumps in salinity-affected areas and analysed using physicochemical variables. A total of 11 sediment samples were collected and analysed for lithology and mineralogy. Due to high level of cations and anions in the groundwater, the study area is highly contaminated. It was observed that the leaching of salt is highly dependent on sediment types and salt-bearing minerals. Attempts were also made to determine the various depth zones responsible for release of salt in shallow aquifers. For sedimentological and mineralogical studies, a piezometer was installed at a maximum depth of 33 m below the ground surface. Based on the results of the study, it was observed that groundwater chemistry is primarily influenced by water-rock interactions, ion exchange processes, weathering (carbonate and silicate), and evaporation.

Epilepsy's unpredictability creates significant work-family conflict for working women, potentially leading to increased unmet needs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the factors related with the unmet needs of working mothers with children with epilepsy (CWE) in Kelantan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A crosssectional study using the validated Malay version of the Family Needs Survey questionnaire was conducted among 204 working mothers aged 18 to 60 of CWE attending specialist hospitals in Kelantan. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The highest unmet need was for community services (81.6%), followed by information (71.9%), social support (53.1%), financial (43.2%), explaining to others (28.9%), and family functioning (28.4%). Having follow-ups at tertiary hospitals reduced the unmet need score for information (B=-0.669, 95%CI=-1.276,0.081, p=0.021) and social support (B=-1.454, 95%CI=-2.225, -0.683, p=&lt;0.001). Living in nuclear types of family reduced the unmet need score for community services (B=-0.669, 95%CI=-1.276,0.081, p=0.021) and information (B=-1.216, 95%CI=-1.965,-0.466, p=0.002). Working in the government sector increased the unmet need score for social support (B=0.437, 95% CI=0.062, 1.454, p=0.033). Full-time employment (B=-0.761, 95%CI=-1.244,-0.279, p=0.002) reduced the unmet need score for family functioning. Contract employment status (B=0.566, 95%CI=0.074,1.058, p=0.024) increased the unmet need score for family functioning. CONCLUSION: Mothers of CWE working in the government sector, under contract employment, and seeking follow-up care in secondary hospitals were related to higher unmet needs.

Estimating geo-mechanical characteristics like Young\u2019s modulus, Shear modulus, and Poisson\u2019s ratio from well logs play a crucial role in reservoir characterization. Sonic logs are used to predict geo-mechanical properties, but the least number of wells are logged for sonic data and specific depths due to practical and financial limitations. The present paper aims to develop a predictive machinelearning model to fill the unknowns, by training six distinct models, linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and KNN. The Volve field open-source data is used to train the model, where three of the five wells have P-wave and S-wave logs. The available data set is trained and validated by a train-test split composition (70%:30%) to further predict the unknown logs. Hyperparameter tuning of the parameters is performed, and the best of the mentioned models, specify to the input data is used for prediction. Random Forest regressor is found to be the best model for the data with the accuracy score R2=0.967 and RMSE=0.12. The predicted logs are then used to develop continuous logs of the geo-mechanical properties of the formation. The tuned model developed can potentially enhance comprehension and prediction of objective parameters. The computed logs can subsequently be integrated with seismic data, facilitating the development of a realistic geostatic model.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal Of The Geological Society Of India"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.17491\/jgsi\/2024\/174000","title":["A GIS and Remote Sensing-based Approach on Supraglacial Lake Dynamics Study in the Himalayan Glaciers"],"author":[{"given":"Litan","family":"Mohanty","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department: Geology & Geophysics 1 , IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur - 721 302 ,","place":["India"]}]},{"given":"Sabyasachi","family":"Maiti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department: Geology & Geophysics 1 , IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur - 721 302 ,","place":["India"]}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The formation of supraglacial lakes is one of such essential indications for the ice mass loss as well as global warming in the glaciers of the high mountains.

Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the key players in TME as they provide pro-tumorigenic milieu for tumour progression and metastasis. These macrophages are primarily regulated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) secreted by breast cancer cells. This study investigated the association of localization of TAMs infiltration within breast carcinoma and CSF-1 expression by cancer cells with the pathological prognostic parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TAMs were assessed in 128 cases of invasive breast carcinoma by CD163 immunohistochemical expression. The median TAM density in both the tumour nest and tumour stroma was utilized to classify TAMs into categories of low and high infiltration. The cancer cells were immunostained with anti-CSF-1 antibody and the staining intensity was evaluated as low or high expression. RESULTS: High nest and stromal TAMs were associated with higher tumour grades (p=0.005 and p=0.0001, respectively) whereas only high stromal TAMs showed significant association with negative oestrogen and progesterone receptors status (p=0.001 and 0.001, respectively); and triple-negative subtype (p=0.002). High CSF-1 expression was significantly associated with high stromal TAMs (p=0.031). High CSF-1 expression was associated with tumour grade and positive HER2 status (p=0.008 and 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: TAMs in tumour nest and stroma showed varying degrees of association with the clinicopathological parameters. High CSF-1 expression was associated with unfavourable prognostic parameters. Therefore, the evaluation of TAMs and CSF-1 expressions could potentially serve as prognostic markers and cellular targets for novel treatment modality in invasive breast cancers.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["IIUM Medical Journal Malaysia"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-5176999\/v1","title":["Systematic quantification of hydrogen in pipeline steel by atom probe tomography after ambient charging and transfer"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3612-8762","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ross","family":"Marceau","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Deakin University"}]},{"given":"Shuohan","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Deakin University"}]},{"given":"Peng","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Deakin University"}]},{"given":"Majid","family":"Laleh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Wollongong"}]},{"given":"Lu","family":"Jiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Deakin University"}]},{"given":"Mike","family":"Tan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Deakin University"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Atom probe tomography (APT) is a promising tool to measure the atomic-scale distribution of hydrogen in solid matter, which can be used to assess the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of materials.

In this study, we developed a comprehensive workflow to analyze intronic APA profiles using the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-regulated transcriptome as a model system. Our investigation revealed two contrasting effects within the transcriptome in response to fluctuations in cellular mTOR activity: an increase in intronic APA for a subset of genes and a decrease for another subset of genes. The application of this workflow to RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that this dichotomous intronic APA pattern is a consistent feature in transcriptomes across both normal tissues and various cancer types. Notably, our analyses of protein length changes resulting from intronic APA events revealed two distinct phenomena in proteome programming: a loss of functional domains due to significant changes in protein length or minimal alterations in C-terminal protein sequences within unstructured regions. Focusing on conserved intronic APA events across 10 different cancer types highlighted the prevalence of the latter cases in cancer transcriptomes, whereas the former cases were relatively enriched in normal tissue transcriptomes. These observations suggest potential, yet distinct, roles for intronic APA events during pathogenic processes and emphasize the abundance of protein isoforms with similar lengths in the cancer proteome. Furthermore, our investigation into the isoform-specific functions of JMJD6 intronic APA events supported the hypothesis that alterations in unstructured C-terminal protein regions lead to functional differences.

This challenge arises when the target domain, which is significantly different from the source domains, remains unknown. However, the performance of current DG ReID relies heavily on labor-intensive source domain annotations. Considering the potential of unlabeled data, we investigate unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) in ReID. Our goal is to create a model that can generalize from unlabeled source domains to semantically retrieve images in an unseen target domain. To address this, we propose a new approach that trains a domain-agnostic expert (DaE) for unsupervised domain-generalizable person ReID. This involves independently training multiple experts to account for label space inconsistencies between source domains. At the same time, the DaE captures domain-generalizable information for testing. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for learning generalizable features under the UDG setting. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art techniques.

In primary total conventional hip replacement, antibiotic cement has a higher rate of revision in the first 6 months and a lower rate after this time compared to plain cement. When revision for infection is analysed, antibiotic cement has a higher rate of revision in the first 3 months and a lower rate of revision for infection after this time compared to plain cement.  In primary total knee replacement, antibiotic cement has a lower rate of revision compared to plain cement.

The NDI is the national mortality database maintained by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The Registry was granted access to this data following a formal ethics application to AIHW.   Adjusted mortality is obtained after direct standardisation of the crude cumulative mortality data by 5 year age intervals and gender to the Estimated Resident Population Status based on the 2001 census.  As the total population has a younger age structure than the population of the Registry, the adjusted mortality is substantially lower than the crude mortality. By minimising the effects of age and gender differences within groups, the adjusted measure may be used to compare the mortality of different procedures and is useful when comparing mortality over time. The rate per 100 person years has been calculated from the date of the first joint procedure to either the date of death or 31 December 2023. This provides a true rate.

Neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8) is a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular functions, primarily through its conjugation to target proteins and subsequent relay of biological signals. However, the role of NEDDylation in VC has not been investigated. In our study, we observed that MLN4924, an inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme, effectively impedes the progression of VC. LC\u2012MS\/MS analysis revealed that poly(ADP\u2012ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is subjected to NEDD8 conjugation, leading to an increase in PARP-1 activity during VC. We subsequently revealed that PARP-1 NEDDylation is mediated by the E3 ligase CBL proto-oncogene B (CBL-b) and is reversed by NEDD8-specific protease 1 (NEDP-1) during VC. Furthermore, the CBL-b C373 peptide effectively mitigated the inactive form of the E3 ligase activity of CBL-b, ultimately preventing VC. These findings provide compelling evidence that the NEDD8-dependent activation of PARP-1 represents a novel mechanism underlying vascular calcification and suggests a promising new therapeutic target for VC.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Experimental &amp; Molecular Medicine"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1007\/s43151-024-00146-x","title":["Horizons of Possibility\u2014Young People\u2019s Encounters with Nature and Their Qualities in Social Programs"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6410-1183","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Niels Ulrik","family":"S\u00f8rensen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anne Mette W.","family":"Nielsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This article presents an analysis of young people\u2019s encounters with nature within a context of social programs. In the intersection between nature and social initiatives, nature is often defined as something that contains a range of inherent properties that can have a positive impact on various aspects of young people\u2019s lives\u2014such as their well-being, development and learning. However, there is a lack of analyses that focus on the manifold, diverse and divergent exchanges and liaisons that young people\u2019s encounters with nature can give rise to. Based on an approach, where humans and nature are considered so intertwined that one cannot be meaningfully understood without the other (Haraway 2021, Latour 2005), the aim of the article is to shed light on the many different types of entanglements and interconnections that unfold in young people\u2019s encounters with nature, as well as on the processes of becoming they are associated with. Drawing on a qualitative study, the article develops a typology of six significant types of entanglements and interconnections between young people and nature. It is a characteristic of these entanglements and interconnections that they unfold depending on how the encounters between young people and nature are framed by the social programs. They are thus not defined by already known outcomes, but can be understood as \u2018figurations\u2019 (Braidotti 1994), that contain both a lived here and now and an \u2018imagined elsewhere\u2019 (Haraway 1991). The article shows how this perspective confronts deficit discourses, where young people in social programs are seen as either lacking resources and agency or whose resources and agency are going in the wrong direction, as well as those contemporary discourses that position and problematize the overall present youth generation as fragile, hypersensitive and disoriented.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Applied Youth Studies"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.23960\/jtep-l.v13i4.1036-1050","title":["Evaluating the Antioxidant Activity and Stability of Pigmented Rice Extract"],"author":[{"given":"Tagor M","family":"Siregar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniel C","family":"Miarsa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This study aims to evaluate the antioxidant activity and stability of the extract of pigmented rice.

Female students who washed vegetables before eating had a high risk of <italic>T. gondii<\/italic> infection (OR = 4.810), followed by raising cats in the house (OR = 3.812), and had a history of blood transfusion (OR = 1.618). \n<bold>Conclusion:<\/bold> This study reported low seroprevalence among female students at Al-Yemenia University, Yemen. Environmental sanitation, personal hygiene, and health education are all required for promotion in order to prevent <italic>Toxoplasma gondii<\/italic> infection among female students.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1007\/s11357-024-01352-4","title":["A biological age based on common clinical markers predicts health trajectory and mortality risk in dogs"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9329-2860","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"S\u00e9bastien","family":"Herzig","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alix","family":"Zollinger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lorane","family":"Texari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"James A.","family":"Holzwarth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rondo P.","family":"Middleton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yuanlong","family":"Pan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pascal","family":"Steiner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0689-9518","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Philipp","family":"Gut","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Predicting aging trajectories through biomarkers of biological aging can guide interventions that optimize healthy lifespan in humans and companion animals. Differences in physiology, genetics, nutrition, and lifestyle limit the generalization of such biomarkers and may therefore require species-specific algorithms. Here, we compared correlations of standard clinical blood parameters with survival probability in humans with those of the two most common mammalian companion animals, cats and dogs, and highlighted universal and species-specific relationships. Based on this comparative analysis, we generated and validated an algorithm that predicts biological age in canines using a longitudinal dataset with health records, blood count, and clinical chemistry from 829 dogs spanning over 12\u00a0years. Positive deviations of biological from chronological age (AgeDev) measured by this composite score significantly correlated with a decreased survival probability (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.75 per 1\u00a0year of AgeDev, <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20093.7e\u2009\u2212\u200906). Importantly, in nearly half of the dogs whose biological age was accelerated by more than 1\u00a0year, none or only a single individual marker scored outside its respective reference range, suggesting practical applications for the detection of unfavorable health trajectories. Analyzing samples from a unique 14-year life-long diet restriction study, we show that restricted caloric intake lowers biological age, an effect that can be quantified at midlife years before a difference in survival is observed. Thus, a biological age clock based on clinical blood tests predicts the health trajectories of dogs for use in research and veterinary practice.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["GeroScience"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.24198\/jmpp.v8i3.52543","title":["Investigation of Employees' Job Satisfaction Determinants on the Services Realization"],"author":[{"given":"Ratih","family":"Pratiwi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Wenny Desty","family":"Febrian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Donny","family":"Dharmawan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Loso","family":"Judijanto","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Roy","family":"Setiawan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The purpose of the research was to investigate the effects of workplace amenities, communication, discipline, and motivation on the job satisfaction of employees of PT.

While mindfulness is often recognized for its Buddhist origins, this research highlights the underexplored connections to Vedic contemplative traditions, demonstrating that secular mindfulness may owe a significant debt to these ancient systems. The study delves into key Vedic concepts such as intrinsic wholeness, perpetual availability, and non-duality, and compares them with the philosophical underpinnings of Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness approach. Through an analysis of primary Vedic texts and Kabat-Zinn's own writings, the paper argues that his secularization of mindfulness is not only an innovative adaptation but also deeply influenced by Vedic philosophy, particularly Advaita Ved\u0101nta. The findings suggest that secular mindfulness, as practiced today, may be more closely aligned with Vedic traditions than previously acknowledged, offering a new perspective on the historical and philosophical roots of this widely adopted practice.\n<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Qeios"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.35942\/mvyvem36","title":["Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation and Sustainability of Community Development Projects in Kitui West Constituency, Kenya"],"author":[{"given":"Veronicah","family":"Zakayo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Paul","family":"Sang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>There are significant challenges faced by project managers in Kitui west constituency when it comes to implementing sustainable projects, in particular, the Community Level Infrastructure Development Program was aimed at promoting equitable development across the entire constituency through implementing small scale infrastructure projects. However, there was a partial or no realization of the envisaged benefits. The aim of this study was therefore be to assess the impact on sustainability for Community Development Projects in Kitui West Constituency, Kenya from Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation. The study was based on theory of sustainability, the ladder of participation, stakeholder theory, modern organizational theory and real assessment theory. Research was conducted using a descriptive design for this study. 10 projects that have been operational within 2016 - 2021 was the target population of this study. The researcher targeted 87 respondents comprising of 20 project management committee and 67 constituency development committee members. The study conducted a census of 87 respondents. The study sample size was 10 projects with 87 respondents. For the purpose of collecting data in this study, a questionnaire was used. The study tested the instruments in Kitui central constituency involving 8 respondents. Research instruments were assessed for content, face, and criterion validity. Reliability was measured using Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (correlation, regression). Results, shown in tables and figures, indicated that community engagement, capacity building, resource use, and communication positively impacted project sustainability. The study concludes that involving community members in project planning, implementation, and evaluation fosters ownership and empowerment. The study recommends that the constituency should involve community members in the planning and decision-making processes is crucial which can be achieved through community meetings, workshops, and

Owusua","family":"Appiah-Agyekum","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Cervical cancer remains a significant public health issue in the United Kingdom, with disparities in screening coverage and outcomes persisting despite robust national programs. This critical analysis evaluates the NHS Cervical Screening Programme (CSP) through the lens of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and global health promotion strategies, such as those outlined in the Ottawa Charter. The analysis explores how individual beliefs about susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers influence participation in cervical screening, while also critiquing the CSP's reliance on these factors to the potential exclusion of broader social determinants of health.\n\nKey findings reveal that while the HBM provides a valuable framework for understanding individual health behaviors, its emphasis on personal responsibility may overlook significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers, leading to inequities in screening uptake. Furthermore, the CSP's approach, though well-intentioned, may inadvertently undermine patient autonomy by promoting a top-down model of health promotion. The analysis is supported by data from the 2022-2023 Cervical Screening Standards Data Report and other contemporary sources, highlighting the need for more culturally sensitive and equitable strategies.\n\nRecommendations for policymakers include the enhancement of targeted interventions for high-risk groups, improved communication strategies, and the integration of a social model of health that considers the broader determinants of health. Future studies are encouraged to explore the sociocultural factors influencing screening behaviors and to evaluate the effectiveness of new screening technologies and integrated HPV vaccination programs. This analysis underscores the importance of rethinking cervical cancer prevention strategies to ensure they are inclusive, equitable, and aligned with the principles of health promotion.\n<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Qeios"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.21123\/bsj.2024.9016","title":["Synergistic Influence of Non-Thermal Plasma and Hydrogen

This study employs a two-dimensional axisymmetric fluid dynamics model to simulate the power density of plasma bombardment on bacteria and access its decontamination effects. The model considers the transport processes of vapor plasma and background gas molecules. Based on the destructive impact of high-speed moving particles in the plasma on bacteria, we investigate the bombardment power density under various conditions, including different laser spot sizes, wavelengths, plate\u2019s tilt angles, and plate-target spacing. The results reveal that the bombardment power density increases with a decrease in laser spot size and wavelength. For instance, when the plate is parallel to the target surface with a 1 mm spacing, the bombardment power density triples as the laser spot size decreases from 0.8 mm to 0.5 mm and quadruples as the wavelength decreases from 1064 nm to 266 nm. Notably, when the plate is parallel to the target with a relatively close spacing of 0.5 mm, the bombardment power density at 0\u00b0 inclination increases sevenfold compared to 45\u00b0. This simulation study is essential for optimizing optical parameters and designing component layouts in decontamination devices using laser-induced plasma. The reduction of laser spot size, wavelength, plate-target spacing and aligning the plate parallel to the target, collectively contribute to achieving precise and effective decontamination.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plasma Science and Technology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1088\/2058-6272\/ad547e","title":["Loss of energetic particles due to feedback control of resistive wall mode in HL-3"],"author":[{"given":"Yifei \u5f0b\u83f2","family":"ZHAO \u8d75","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yueqiang \u94ba\u5f3a","family":"LIU \u5218","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guangzhou \u5e7f\u5468","family":"HAO \u90dd","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zhengxiong \u6b63\u6c79","family":"WANG \u738b","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guanqi \u51a0\u5d0e","family":"DONG \u8463","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shuo \u7855","family":"WANG \u738b","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chunyu \u6625\u96e8","family":"LI \u674e","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guanming \u51a0\u94ed","family":"YANG \u6768","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yutian \u96e8\u7530","family":"MIAO \u82d7","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yongqin \u96cd\u94a6","family":"WANG \u738b","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Effects of three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field perturbations due to feedback control of an unstable <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math\/>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula> (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <jats:tex-math\/>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula> is toroidal mode number) resistive wall mode (RWM) on the energetic particle (EP) losses are systematically investigated for the HL-3 tokamak.

The RWM is found to generally produce no EP loss for co-current particles in HL-3. Assuming the same perturbation level at the sensor location for the close-loop system, feedback produces nearly the same loss of counter-current EPs compared to the open-loop case. Assuming however that the sensor signal is ten times smaller in the close-loop system than the open-loop counter part (reflecting the fact that the RWM is more stable with feedback), the counter-current EP loss is found significantly reduced in the former.

In continuation of this work, model III is presented in this paper in the year 2023. The main components of this mechanism are traditional billing, time-of-day billing, and an optional facility to use renewable energy by implementing net metering. The combination of these elements generates three distinct billing mechanisms. These have several advantages, like the profits of the existing mechanism, renewable integration, grid stability, demand management, cost saving, environmental benefits, and customer empowerment. The projected billing mechanism is developed and implemented in MATLAB software, and a real-time application is created. The comparison between these three mechanisms helps in giving the best mechanism with respect to residential consumers.

Statistical tools such as frequency counts, percentages, mean, standard deviation, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Kendall's tau-b were employed for a comprehensive analysis. The data analysis revealed that a majority of respondents identified as auditory learners, expressing agreement with the flipped classroom model and demonstrating excellent performance within this learning environment. Significantly, the positive attitude and excellent performance exhibited no significant differences across various learning styles. Clear evidence emerged indicating that a positive attitude toward the flipped classroom correlated with exceptional academic achievements.

In order to anticipate energy consumption in these neglected areas effectively, this study suggests a novel method that combines inverse matrix method (IMM) with linear regression method (LRM). The model produces accurate estimates by using historical data on energy use and relevant factors, such as weather patterns, population dynamics, economic indicators, and seasonal trends. A case study focusing on distant areas in Bangladesh shows how the proposed technique might be applied. The outcomes indicate how well the method captures the complex patterns of energy demand and how it may be used to guide sustainable energy management plans in these outlying regions. This study advances energy planning and resource allocation in areas with a limited supply of energy, paving the way for increased development and efficiency of the energy sector.

The use of CARTOS to substitute concentrates at 75% and 100% decreased average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) (p&lt;0.01); therefore, the addition of CARTOS up to 50% maintained ADG and G:F in beef cattle.Conclusion: CARTOS can replace concentrates up to 50% in beef cattle diets without adversely affecting feed intake, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation characteristics, blood parameters, or growth performance of beef cattle.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Animal Bioscience"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.52028\/tce-sc.v02.i03.art07.sc","title":["Contribuindo para o debate sobre Parcerias P\u00fablico-Privadas (PPPs) e concess\u00f5es no Brasil: saneamento b\u00e1sico \u2013 \u00e9 sustent\u00e1vel, \u00e9 infra, \u00e9 pop... \u00c9 ESG"],"author":[{"given":"Ant\u00f4nio Felipe","family":"de Oliveira Rodrigues","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Caroline","family":"de Souza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Igor","family":"Guadagnin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maira","family":"Luz Galdino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Manuela","family":"Coutinho Domingues Marinho","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rafael","family":"Galv\u00e3o de Souza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rog\u00e9rio Alessandre","family":"Loch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Teresa Cristina","family":"de Jesus Guimar\u00e3es Moura","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>O presente trabalho t\u00e9cnico discute a import\u00e2ncia dos requisitos ambientais, sociais e de governan\u00e7a na busca pela universaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do saneamento b\u00e1sico no Brasil, enfatizando a Agenda Environmental, Social and Governance (Agenda ESG), como requisito para a viabilidade de financiamentos, e pelo sucesso de projetos nesse setor, destacando que n\u00e3o se trata de um modismo, mas de uma mudan\u00e7a de paradigma para superar diversos desafios de infraestrutura.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Revista do Tribunal de Contas do Estado de Santa Catarina"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.5325\/chaucerrev.59.4.0497","title":["A <i>merveillous desir<\/i>: Authorship, Ethics, and Knowing Others in the <i>Clerk\u2019s Tale<\/i>"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9295-2943","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Sarah Elliott","family":"Novacich","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, (sarah.novacich@rutgers.edu)"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article examines Walter\u2019s uncertainty and suspicion about Griselda\u2019s true feelings as a way of thinking through the relationship between authors and characters in the Clerk\u2019s Tale.

To protect user privacy, the client's query and the data holders' sets should remain encrypted throughout the whole process. Prior work on Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Membership Test (PMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) falls short in this scenario in many ways. They either require data holders to possess the sets in plaintext, incur prohibitively high latency for aggregating results from a large number of data holders, leak the information about the party holding the intersection element, or induce a high false positive. This paper introduces the primitive of a Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT). We give a basic construction of a protocol to solve PSMT using a threshold variant of approximate-arithmetic homomorphic encryption and show how to overcome existing challenges to construct a PSMT protocol without leaking information about the party holding the intersection element or false positives for a large number of data holders ensuring IND-CPA^D security. Our novel approach is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in scalability with regard to the number of supported data holders. This is enabled by a novel summation-based homomorphic membership check rather than a product-based one, as well as various novel ideas addressing technical challenges. Our PSMT protocol supports many more parties (up to 4096 in experiments) compared to prior related work that supports only around 100 parties efficiently. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method's aggregation of results from data holders can run in 92.5s for 1024 data holders and a set size of 2^25, and our method's overhead increases very slowly with the increasing number of senders.

Although this practice reduces engineering costs, it also introduces the risk of inadvertent privacy breaches due to misconfiguration errors or incomplete documentation. Our research investigated secure messaging apps' usage of Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service to send push notifications to Android devices. We analyzed 21 popular secure messaging apps from the Google Play Store to determine what personal information these apps leak in the payload of push notifications sent via FCM. Of these apps, 11 leaked metadata, including user identifiers (10 apps), sender or recipient names (7 apps), and phone numbers (2 apps), while 4 apps leaked the actual message content. Furthermore, none of the data we observed being leaked to FCM was specifically disclosed in those apps' privacy disclosures. We also found several apps employing strategies to mitigate this privacy leakage to FCM, with varying levels of success. Of the strategies we identified, none appeared to be common, shared, or well-supported. We argue that this is fundamentally an economics problem: incentives need to be correctly aligned to motivate platforms and SDK providers to make their systems secure and private by default.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2174\/0115665232279426240217174738","title":["Effect of Bovine Lactoferrin Treatment on Iron Homeostasis and Gene\nExpression Changes in Multiple Organ Dysfunctions During Wound\nHealing Process in Rats"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7293-0974","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Ahmet Sarper","family":"Bozkurt","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Gaziantep, Gaziantep, Turkey"}]},{"given":"\u015eenay G\u00f6r\u00fcc\u00fc","family":"Y\u0131lmaz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Nutrition and Dietetics,\nFaculty of Health Science, University of Gaziantep, Gaziantep, Turkey"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Background:<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Injury systemically disrupts the homeostatic balance and can cause organ\nfailure.

It is based on publicly available data related to introducing five selected DSTs based on the similarity of both their design and the economic situation of the countries in which they were introduced. The collected revenue, fiscal efficiency of these taxes, and taxpayers\u2019 reactions strongly indicate that DSTs have been passed on to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers to a great extent while yielding negligible revenues that contradicts their policy goals.

Utilizing a mediation analysis approach, the research examined the interplay among online disinhibition, moral disengagement, and cyber incivility. The participant consisted of 780 Indonesian students, with an average age of 20.3 years, who reported spending 4-7 hours daily on social media. The study was conducted via an online survey distributed to participants. Moral disengagement was assessed using a Moral Disengagement Scale, cyber incivility was measured with a purpose-built scale, and online disinhibition was evaluated using the Online Disinhibition Scale to measure levels of online disinhibition. Findings indicated a significant correlation among the variables, with a substantial portion of participants exhibiting moderate to high levels of online disinhibition, moral disengagement, and cyber incivility. Mediation analysis further revealed that online disinhibition mediated the relationship between moral disengagement and cyber incivility, suggesting that the lowering of inhibitions online facilitates the manifestation of uncivil behavior, influenced by moral disengagement. This study underscores the complex mechanisms driving cyber incivility, highlighting the crucial mediating role of online disinhibition between moral disengagement and cyber incivility.

However, in the Global South, until recently only the minority of workers in formal employment and public sector employees enjoyed the right to social security. This has changed since the 2000s through the rise of non-contributory \u2018social cash transfers\u2019 (SCT) for the poor. We investigate what entitlements to SCT have been created, and how close they come to human rights standards, based on a self-constructed dataset that covers the entire Global South. In conjunction with the analysis of SCT, the chapter also makes a more general contribution to the conceptual analysis of social rights. We argue that rights-based social security has a multidimensional and systemic nature that requires complex institutional designs, and these may be elusive in many countries of the Global South. First, multidimensionality:\u00a0the right to social security is multidimensional, and social security must be designed in a way to meet human rights standards in all dimensions. Universal coverage, on which policymakers focus (\u2018universal social protection\u2019), is only one of these dimensions. Second, systemic design:\u00a0the ensemble of all programmes in a country (the national SCT system or \u2018regime\u2019) counts when it comes to assessing the human rights quality of social security. Therefore, the challenge is to design composite systems rather than only single programmes, on which policymakers focus. Third, institutional designs must be systemic also in normative terms:\u00a0to be accepted as socially just, a national SCT system needs to combine diverse normative principles, and these must be rooted in citizens\u2019 beliefs and attitudes as well as national politics\u2014reference to broad global ideas such as universalism, inclusiveness, or even human rights is not enough. These three requirements are demanding, and we find that most SCT designs do not meet human rights standards. At the same time, we argue that the right to social security is only broadly defined and can be realized through a variety of institutional designs, thereby creating leeway for rights-based policies.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Politics of Welfare in the Global South"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/9780197698716.003.0008","title":["Gender in Welfare in the South"],"author":[{"given":"Cleopas Gabriel","family":"Sambo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This chapter focuses on gender in the implementation of social assistance programs, particularly cash transfers, in the Global South. While social cash transfers (SCTs) target the most vulnerable populations, they are designed not only for consumption soothing but also to address the underlying structures that perpetuate vulnerability and deprivation. In Zambia, where evidence of gendered poverty is prevalent, SCTs have prioritized women as recipients and \u2018managers\u2019 of the transfer within households, intending to foster their empowerment. However, current scholarship on the feminization of poverty suggests that merely centring women as transfer recipients without critically examining the norms contributing to their subjugation may hinder their progress towards empowerment. Drawing on interviews with individuals in poverty who receive cash transfers, this chapter examines the inherent contradictions between assumptions and realities of gender and empowerment in SCT households in Zambia. It interrogates the impact of gender norms embedded in this welfare programme on intra-household dynamics and the subsequent consequences for the empowerment of both men and women benefiting from such programmes. The chapter argues that the indiscriminate adoption of gender norms originating from the Global North, although perceived as progressive, often reinforces existing stereotypes and perpetuates gendered inequalities. It emphasizes the need for gender-sensitive social protection interventions encompassing broader livelihood strategies.

The aim of this study is to gain insights into the complex flow patterns and vortex structures within the sump, focusing on their behavior under varying flow rates. The Shear Stress Transfer (SST) k-\u03c9 model is utilized to capture turbulence, and the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to visualize the water-air interface. Model tests are conducted to validate the simulations. The findings suggest that under low flow conditions, the flow beneath the bell mouth becomes highly turbulent, leading to the formation of a complex vortex system with three distinct high-pressure zones. With increasing flow rates, the shape and strength of these high-pressure zones fluctuate, and a quadrupole vortex structure emerges at the sump bottom. This quadrupole vortex plays a pivotal role in the transformation of a floor-attached vortex upward, culminating in a dual vortex column structure.

Repurposing of existing drugs for clinical tumor\ntreatment is an attractive and effective strategy. Loperamide is a commonly used anti-diarrheal\ndrug with excellent safety profiles.

Moreover, the effects of loperamide on apoptosis in melanoma cells\nand potential mechanisms were explored by Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection, cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, reactive oxygen species level detection, and apoptosis-correlation proteins analysis. Furthermore, loperamide-suppressed melanoma metastasis was studied by\nmigration and invasion assays. What\u2019s more, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence\nstaining assays were applied to demonstrate the mechanism of loperamide against melanoma in vivo.

Proses pengukuran keberlanjutan program dilakukan menggunakan mix-methods penggabungan antara kualitatif dan kuantitatif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa program biogas memiliki dampak positif yang signifikan terhadap ekonomi rumah tangga dan kemandirian energi di masyarakat. Masyarakat sangat yakin akan manfaat biogas dalam menghemat bahan bakar fosil, mengurangi biaya rumah tangga, dan menciptakan peluang usaha baru. Meskipun demikian, terdapat kekhawatiran terkait distribusi biogas ke rumah tangga yang membutuhkan dan kualitas instalasi sistem biogas yang ada. Secara keseluruhan, keberlanjutan dimensi ekonomi dari program biogas sangat positif dengan nilai rata-rata dan indeks yang tinggi pada setiap indikator. Penggunaan biogas menawarkan berbagai keuntungan dari penghematan biaya hingga penciptaan peluang usaha baru, yang mendukung kesejahteraan ekonomi masyarakat. Dalam konteks lingkungan, program energi biogas juga menunjukkan hasil yang sangat positif. Masyarakat melihat biogas sebagai teknologi yang bersih, tidak menimbulkan bau, tidak mencemari kualitas air, dan bermanfaat untuk pertanian melalui penggunaan bioslurry. Tingginya nilai rata-rata dan indeks pada setiap indikator menunjukkan bahwa biogas memberikan manfaat lingkungan yang signifikan. Keberlanjutan dimensi kelembagaan program biogas juga menunjukkan bahwa dukungan masyarakat yang kuat sangat penting untuk memastikan kesuksesan jangka panjang program ini.

The trend has intensified since the Lisbon Treaty, which codified agencies as part of the EU\u2019s institutional machinery. A new type of independent EU agency, endowed with considerable powers, has emerged, especially in the energy sector. This article focuses on the agencification phenomenon in the EU energy sector and, more specifically, the delegation of power and the use of institutional margins of discretion in that context. While agencies have a margin of discretion within which they can make decisions that have general application, this discretion should be limited to scientific and technical questions; questions of a political nature should fall outside that margin. From a practical point of view, the challenge is that the divide between what is technical or scientific and what is political is not always clear. The article argues that the delegated rule-making by Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulator (ACER) in the EU energy sector stretches the boundaries of the Meroni doctrine by subsuming questions that are not solely technical in nature but may involve political discretion as well.<\/jats:italic>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["European Energy and Environmental Law Review"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/njh.0000000000001060","title":["Pragmatic Trial of Palliative Care Support Using Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes Mentoring"],"author":[{"given":"Sabina","family":"Kupershmidt","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Anne","family":"Pithan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Cheryl","family":"Fischbach","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Katie","family":"Pudwill","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Charlene","family":"Berke","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Angela","family":"Kroeze Visser","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michele","family":"Snyders","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Deborah","family":"Kullerd","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Increasing rates of chronic diseases and an aging population have placed palliative care at the forefront of public health efforts.

However, the main\nlimitation of these complexes is their low hydrolytic stability. After these two classes, a third generation\ntitanium based complex, i.e. diaminebis(phenolato)bis(alkoxo) titanium(IV), was invented,\nwhich showed more hydrolytic stability and high cytotoxicity than budotitane and titanocene\ndichloride.

The mechanism of Ti(IV) complexes of diaminebis(phenolato)\nbis(alkoxo) is under investigation and is presumed to involve Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\nstress, which leads to apoptosis.

The difficulty is to achieve tritium breeding ratio (TBR) target of 1.05 or more. This paper presents a new design approach to the blanket design process. It indicates that fusion blanket design is affected by universal functions based on iterations. Three aspects are worth more attention from fusion engineers in the future. The first factor is that the iterations on the material fractions affect not only structure scheme but also TBR variation. The second factor is the cooling condition affecting final TBR due to the change of the structure material proportion. The third factor is temperature field related to the tritium release. In particular, it is suggested that the statistical calculation of effective TBR must be under reasonable control of the blanket temperature field. This approach is novel for blanket engineering in development of a fusion reactor.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plasma Science and Technology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1123\/jab.2024-0068","title":["Concussion History Moderates Trunk Motion and Lower Extremity Biomechanical Relationships During Jump Landing and Cutting"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0006-8566-5918","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Kayla M.","family":"Kowalczyk","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"UGA Concussion Research Laboratory, UGA Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5574-0071","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Eric J.","family":"Shumski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UGA Concussion Research Laboratory, UGA Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9363-1391","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Julianne D.","family":"Schmidt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UGA Concussion Research Laboratory, UGA Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0785-6640","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Robert C.","family":"Lynall","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UGA Concussion Research Laboratory, UGA Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Concussion history, trunk motion, and lower extremity biomechanics associate with musculoskeletal injury risk.

In this paper, I explore the role of regime type in determining the likelihood of state survival under extreme environmental conditions. I begin with a theoretical and empirical analysis of public goods provision under different regime types, finding no evidence for the contention that any one particular regime is superior to others. Following from this, I argue that the survival of the state under increased hazard conditions will at least partly be a function of political flexibility, with more democratic regimes better able to weather crisis than non-democratic ones. I explore this argument by analysing two historical cases of climate change: the non-democratic Maya civilisation in the first millennium and the quasi-democratic Icelandic state at the start of the second millennium. These historical cases highlight potential advantages to the democratic system in allowing states to survive a world with increased hazards but also underscore how rising competition and political instability can negatively impact those same democratic institutions.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            This article was published open access under a CC BY licence:\n            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licences\/by\/4.0\">https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licences\/by\/4.0<\/jats:ext-link>\n            .\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Global Environment"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2174\/1570180820666230509095446","title":["Current Formulation Strategies to Design Novel Carriers for Targeted Drug Delivery and Management of Infectious Keratitis: A Comprehensive Review on the Present State of the Art"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1232-4953","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Tumpa","family":"Sarkar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh, 786004, Assam, India"}]},{"given":"Mohini","family":"Singh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh, 786004, Assam, India"}]},{"given":"Bani Kumar","family":"Jana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh, 786004, Assam, India"}]},{"given":"Bhaskar","family":"Mazumder","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh, 786004, Assam, India"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Objective:<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Infectious keratitis is a pernicious disease that affects the anterior segment of the\neye and is one the leading causes of blindness worldwide.

Seventeen adults completed three 8-minute overground walking trials during 3 separate visits. The stride time series was calculated as the time difference between consecutive right heel contact events within the footswitch and smartphone-accelerometry signals. Linear (average stride time, stride time standard deviation, and stride time coefficient of variation) and nonlinear (fractal scaling index, approximate entropy, and sample entropy) measures were calculated for each stride time series.

Secondly, sequence feature analysis showed the full-length sequence of HCRSV-ZZ was 3,909 nucleotides (nt) in length and had a similar genomic structure with other carmovirus. It contains a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), followed by seven open reading frames encoding for P28, P23, P81, P8, P9, P38, and P25, and the last a 3-terminal UTR.

The medical charts of 10 patients with confirmed MLD were retrospectively reviewed. We used a simplified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring system and clinical status, including survival. We analyzed the correlations between the scores of specific neuroimaging lesions and clinical status in two groups, categorized as late-infantile and juvenile types based on the age at symptom onset.Results: We detected a positive relationship between clinical function deterioration and MRI score (rho=0.59, P=0.002) in patients with MLD.

Control was applied through splitter-plate trailing-edge spanwise waviness (passive), spanwise-arranged microjet blowing actuators (active), and their combination (hybrid). Passive and hybrid control successfully alleviate the tone, whereas active control amplifies and alters the tone frequency.

Mean WC for ChatGPT 4 was 312.54, ChatGPT 3.5 355.78, FDA labels 1220, and Google snippets 42. Significant differences in FRES were found among sources for Afatinib (p-value &lt;0.0001), Erlotinib (p-value 0.0206), Osimertinib (p-value &lt;0.0001), Dacomitinib (p-value 0.0125), and Gefitinib (p-value &lt;0.0001). Significant differences in WC were also found among sources for Afatinib (p-value &lt;0.0001), Erlotinib (p-value &lt;0.0001), Osimertinib (p-value &lt;0.0001), and Gefitinib (p-value 0.0045). No significant difference in WC was found for Dacomitinib (p-value 0.2807).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            While the FDA label provided the most readable information, none of the sources aligned with the average 8th-grade reading level in the US, indicating a gap in accessible patient education for NSCLC targeted therapies. Notably, readability varies significantly between ChatGPT versions, affecting accessibility for users of the free version, ChatGPT 3.5. Although ChatGPT responses are more succinct compared to the verbose FDA labels, their higher education-level readability presents a barrier to comprehension. This study highlights the need for further research into optimizing AI-generated patient education materials to be both accurate and comprehensible at appropriate reading levels, thereby improving health communication strategies.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.411","title":["A multi-modal EHR-based approach to screen patients for oncology clinical trials."],"author":[{"given":"Anosheh","family":"Afghahi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Filip","family":"Frahm","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Maneet","family":"Kaur","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Yichen","family":"Lu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Catharine Kline","family":"Cipolla","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Barry","family":"Leybovich","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Ivy","family":"Altomare","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Neal J.","family":"Meropol","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Flatiron Health, New York, NY"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>411<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Inefficiencies in patient (pt) screening may impair enrollment in oncology trials and could potentially be mitigated by a centralized trial matching infrastructure. The objective of this study was to implement a novel clinical trial screening service using electronic health record (EHR)-based structured variables, machine learning (ML) and human abstraction.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            To construct the model, we defined a set of inclusion and exclusion (IE) criteria unique to each trial and routinely documented in EHRs. Patients that met IE criteria via structured and ML-extracted clinical data were selected for review by trained specialists via a technology-enabled abstraction platform. Real-time notifications for eligible pts were issued via EHR alerts to research teams at participating study sites.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Between January and May 2024, over 80,000 pts were screened prior to a clinic visit for two trials at three sites. Using structured IE criteria alone, 98.7% and 99.6% of pts were excluded. An additional 31.9% of pts were excluded when employing ML modeling. A total of 15 (3.0%) and 5 (4.0%) pts were deemed eligible when using structured, ML, and abstraction-based criteria (Table). Seventeen percent of surfaced pts were consented within 10 days of implementation. Median time for abstractor confirmation of pt eligibility was 13.3 hours (interquartile range: 2.8, 27.4) with abstraction of highest priority pts taking a median of 3.0 and 9.9 hours, respectively.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Our results support the implementation of a centralized, technology-enabled pt screening service for effective trial eligibility assessments across large patient populations. The value of using structured, ML- and abstraction-based data models, improved accuracy by more than 95% compared to structured data alone. The impact of multi-modal centralized screening is being evaluated across additional clinical trials in a nationwide community oncology research network.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:table content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                <jats:thead content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"3\" content-type=\"border-bottom align-left\" rowspan=\"1\">Pts, No. (% pts excluded).<\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\"\/>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      <jats:bold>Trial 1<\/jats:bold>\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      <jats:bold>Trial 2<\/jats:bold>\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:thead>\n                <jats:tbody>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">1.

The high administrative burden to complete peer to peer\u2019s (P2P) and appeals leads to care delays and revenue losses. At our tertiary academic cancer center, in partnership with our cancer registry and Epic teams, we shifted the clerical work required for PAs from clinicians to certified tumor registrars (CTRs) to increase authorization efficiency and decrease financial losses from denials.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Clinicians place the treatment plan order which goes to the CTR work queue. We leveraged the Epic staging smart form to consolidate and auto-populate common elements needed for PA. The CTRs then complete and validate the form prior to the authorization specialists obtaining the PA. We compared the pre (1\/2022-9\/2022) and post-implementation (11\/2022-4\/2024) periods on our primary outcomes: average monthly number of PAs pending review (including P2P, appeals and authorizations requiring clarifying clinical documentation), average monthly denial rate and average time spent on PAs by the authorization specialists. We compared the financial losses from denied PAs from calendar year 2022 to 2023. Analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            There was a 1.4% reduction in the average monthly number of PA\u2019s pending review (350 vs 345). The average monthly authorized rate was steady from the beginning of the intervention (94%) to present time (95%). The average monthly denial rate was 2.9% at the beginning of the intervention and 0.9% at present time. There was a consistent decrease in the average time a PA was spent in pending review status: 118 hours in 2022, 102 hours in 2023 and 79 hours in quarter 1 of 2024. Despite the overall increase in volume of authorizations submitted, there was an overall cost savings of $27,392,894 from 2022 ($49,964,703) to 2023 ($22,571,809) from the decrease in denials. In 2022, 6.2% of total approved charges were denied and this decreased to 2.7% in 2023.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            By leveraging the EHR and optimizing existing non-clinical staff workflows, we maintained sustained average authorized and denial rates despite overall volume going up due to improved authorization efficiency and reduced financial losses due to denials. Additionally, there were overall cost savings for the institution due to the decreased percent of denials of total approved charges.

Studies have indicated that worse outcomes can be linked to disparities in sex, race, and ethnicity. Research indicates that despite a greater incidence of oral cancer among White patients, the five-year survival rate for Black patients is 52%, compared to 70% for their counterparts (1). While existing research focuses on racial and ethnic disparities in the time to diagnosis and prognosis, there is limited literature that discusses disparities in time to treat. As such, our study aims to evaluate potential racial, ethnic, and\/or gender disparities in the time between diagnosis and surgery.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating 185 patients with oral cancer at the University of Miami. Patient information was obtained from electronic medical records. We performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests. Levene's test was used to assess the homogeneity of variances assumption. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The mean age at diagnosis was 68.50 years (SD =13.079 years), with the majority of patients (42%) diagnosed as Stage 1. Our cohort was 46% female and 54% male. 62% identified as White and Non-Hispanic\/Latinx, 29% as White and Hispanic\/Latinx, 6% as Black, and 3% as other race\/ethnicities. We also assessed time to treat as a function of gender, race and ethnicity. We found there was no significant difference between men and women (x\u0304= 148 vs 136 days) in time to surgery. We also found no difference between Hispanic\/Latinx patients and non Hispanic\/Latinx patients (x\u0304= 163 vs 137 days). Although not statistically significant, there was a notable trend in the data that showed a longer time to surgery. Black patients had a much greater time to surgical intervention compared to White patients (x\u0304= 308 days vs 134 days) (Table). At the time of data cutoff, nearly 81% of patients were alive.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In conclusion, despite lack of statistical significant, our study found higher trends to time to surgery between Hispanic\/Latinx and non-Hispanic\/Latinx, and even more so a much greater difference in time to surgery between Black and White patients. Further research is needed to elucidate these potential systematic, socio-economic or cultural barriers to ensure equitable access. 1.

It predicts the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy. Delivering OncotypeDx results in a timely manner is important to inform treatment decisions. As a quality improvement project, we implemented a strategy to reduce the Turn Around Time (TAT) from breast surgery to OncotypeDx report at Bellevue Cancer Center, the tertiary referral center of the NYC Health and Hospitals System.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The primary measure was TAT from surgery to receiving OncotoypeDx result in electronic medical record (EMR). We compared TAT before and after implementation of the strategy. The historical control was from 5\/2021 through 3\/2022, while the group after strategy implementation was from 6\/2023 to 1\/2024. The strategy revolved around streamlining the identification of eligible patients by collaborating with the breast surgery team, creating and utilizing a smart phrase in the EMR. It also involved ordering OncotypeDx by closely communicating with the pathology department, obtaining insurance approval by working with the OncotypeDx vendor, and tracking OncotypeDx results. The above process was done by a breast surgery provider that offered real time updates in the EMR.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The patient groups were similar both before and after implementing the strategy, including patient number (26 and 27 respectively) and patient mean age (61 and 59). The majority of both groups were minority patients (77% and 81%). We found that a higher percentage of patients were from Medically Underserved Areas and Populations (MUA\/P) in the group after strategy implementation (35% and 56%). Our strategy reduced the average TAT from 56 days to 30 days.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            We developed a strategy to optimize the OncotypeDx workflow in a large safety net health system despite an increase in patients from MUA\/P.

multitude of radiologic exams. A small number of these IPNs can harbor lung cancer (LC). To aide LC detection rates, hospitals must identify and validate the completion of appropriate follow-up regarding IPNs in a timely manner. The problem with timely referral and completion of work up is found to be amplified in safety-net settings with limited resources. John Peter Smith (JPS) hospital, a safety-net hospital, has developed a method to identify, track, and refer patients presenting with IPNs.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            JPS has created an algorithm to classify all IPNs by means of Thynk Health, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify and track incidental findings and lung cancer screening patients (LCS). The algorithm created a scoring system by combining Fleischner Society (2017) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) LCS (Lung-RADS) guideline recommendations. The scoring system was designed to mimic Lung-RADS established by the ACR (1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B). The assigned score creates a risk stratification to assist providers in the patient\u2019s care plan. Using NLP, the project queried radiologic exams performed at JPS searching for key terminology relating to IPNs. Findings were then reviewed by radiology staff for validity and assigned a score based on the algorithm. Program exclusions, when identified in the radiology report, included: patient &lt; 35 years, patient has known cancer or under surveillance of oncology team, abnormalities favoring infectious process, LCS patients and when nodule size is not reported in the radiologist\u2019s dictation.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            A current state analysis was completed from 3\/25\/24 to 4\/25\/24. The AI platform analyzed 5,276 CT exams (2049 abdomen, 1347 head\/neck, and 1880 chest) involving partial or complete imaging of the lungs. A total of 727 (13.8%) IPNs were flagged for review. After excluding exams falling outside of the set program parameters, a total of 178 (3.4%) IPNs were identified. 21 (11.8%) of the IPNs identified received a score of 4A or 4B. Patients found to have a score of 4A (11, 6.2%) and 4B (10, 5.6%) underwent additional review.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Our team has created a unique system that can be used as a model for other large health systems. By leveraging technology, we are able to successfully identify key factors associated with IPNs to help ensure patients receive the recommended care in a timely manner.\n            <jats:table-wrap

recommend early palliative care (PC) for patients with advanced cancer, defined as referral within 8 weeks of diagnosis. Early referral has been associated with improved quality of life, survival and a reduction in healthcare utilization at the end of life. We sought to determine the role of sociodemographic and clinical patient factors on timing of referral to an embedded supportive oncology (SO) practice and impact on utilization.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patients \u226518 years with advanced cancer who first received a SO visit between 01\/01\/2021-06\/30\/2023 were included. Data on patient demographics, cancer treatment and mortality were extracted from the electronic health record. Early referral to SO was defined as a visit &lt;3 months after diagnosis of advanced cancer. We used descriptive statistics to summarize patients\u2019 sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, and multivariable linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with the timing of referrals.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Of the 782 patients, 39.1% were referred early. Poorer functional status (p&lt;0.001) and certain cancer types (p&lt;0.01) were associated with earlier referrals. There were significant differences in timing of referral by cancer type with highest early rates among Head and Neck (53%,) GI (48%), Lung (46%) and GYN (43%) and lowest among GU (29%) and Breast (11%; p &lt; 0.001). Those with Medicare as the primary insurance had an increase in referral time (138 days) compared to Medicaid patients (p&lt;0.001). Patients whose primary symptom was pain were referred earlier than patients with other non-pain symptoms although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.084). Patients with an earlier referral had more ED visits and hospitalizations both before (p=0.001 and p&lt; 0.001, respectively) and after (p=0.186 and p=0.007, respectively) referral compared to those referred later. Overall, there was no difference in mean referral times between 2021 (483d) and 2023 (533d).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            There remains significant disparities in the timing of referrals to SO based on sociodemographic and clinical factors. While early SO referral is associated with several benefits, the variability in referral timing underscores the need for targeted strategies to promote timely access to PC. Moving forward, efforts should focus on developing standardized referral protocols and addressing barriers to early PC access to ensure equitable and optimal patient outcomes.\n

<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Clinical trials have shown that collecting electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) improves quality of life and survival in cancer patients. To bolster integration of ePROs into routine care, the SIMPRO Research Consortium developed an electronic symptom management (eSyM) program, deployed it at six cancer centers, and conducted a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study. eSyM, an ePRO toolkit integrated into the Epic EHR, enables patients to report and care teams to triage symptoms in real-time. To assess eSyM, we conducted structured qualitative interviews with patients and clinic staff, including doctors, nurses, advanced practice providers, and administrative staff. We sought to understand eSyM from the patient and staff perspectives.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Using an iterative process, we developed semi-structured interview guides to query the experiences and perceptions of patients and staff exposed to eSyM. Questions were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. One year after eSyM was launched, sites identified and referred participants for interviews or focus groups. Participants must have either used eSyM to submit symptoms (patients) or had access to eSyM at their institution (staff). Patients provided written consent; a consent waiver was obtained for staff. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and a common analytic codebook was developed. Transcripts were dual or triple-coded and underwent thematic analysis to identify key contexts and concepts within and across patient and staff groups.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            From 9\/28\/20 to 4\/14\/23, 50 staff participated in individual interviews and 29 participated in focus groups (79 total). From 9\/14\/23 to 3\/14\/24, 14 patient interviews were conducted. Transcripts revealed that staff and patients held similar beliefs regarding eSyM compatibility, communication, and prioritization. 93% (13\/14) of patients and 72% (57\/79) of staff believed eSyM was easy to use and improved communication. Both cohorts (66% staff, 36% patients) noted that competing demands often needed to be prioritized over responding to symptom concerns. Discordance emerged in the domains of receptivity and technology; patients were more receptive and capable of using eSyM than staff perceived. Both groups believed eSyM was helpful but perceived that deeper engagement from patients and staff was necessary for sustainability.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Most interviewees reported that eSyM added value and was easy to navigate. Competing clinical demands, however, frequently deprioritized use of eSyM. Staff tended to underestimate patients\u2019 receptivity to use eSyM and were more likely to cite competing demands as a barrier to their own use of eSyM. Sites looking to adopt eSyM, or similar ePRO programs, will benefit from understanding the facilitators that need to be incorporated and the barriers that need to be surmounted to optimize success.\n            <jats:related-object document-id=\"NCT03850912\" document-id-type=\"clinical-trial-number\" source-id=\"10.18810\/clinical-trials-gov\" source-id-type=\"crossref-doi\" source-type=\"clinical-trials-registry\">\n              Clinical trial information:\n              <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03850912\">NCT03850912<\/jats:ext-link>\n            <\/jats:related-object>\n            .\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.111","title":["Access and adherence to cancer care through the Veteran Affairs Close to Me cancer care service."],"author":[{"given":"Jenna","family":"Shields","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"VA National Oncology Program Office, Washington, DC"}]},{"given":"Alyson","family":"Clough","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"VA National TeleOncology, Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC"}]},{"given":"Erin R.","family":"Valenti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"VA National TeleOncology, VA National Oncology Program Office, Durham, NC"}]},{"given":"Gina","family":"McWhirter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC"}]},{"given":"Michael J.","family":"Kelley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"VA National Oncology Program and Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC"}]},{"given":"Vida Almario","family":"Passero","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"VA National TeleOncology, VA National Oncology Program Office, Durham, NC"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>111<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Diagnosing and treating more than 56,000 Veterans annually, the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Oncology Program (NOP) is one of the nation\u2019s largest integrated providers of oncology services. Within VA, oncology care and parenteral therapies are primarily offered at VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) in urban areas, often inaccessible to rural patients. Issues with travel distance, parking, time, and caregiver support can prevent patients from adhering to treatment appointments as evidenced by historical annual No-Show rates for VAMC infusion clinics that range from 1.1-6.7%. To mitigate potential barriers to access, NOP launched the Close to Me (CTM) cancer care service. The service deploys Registered Nurses (RNs) to local VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) to administer cancer treatments. VA has opened 23 CTM clinics across 5 geographical regions since October 2021.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The CTM service was implemented at VAMCs with NOP providing direct project management, safety assessment and resources such as a comprehensive implementation toolkit, standard operating procedures, care coordination tools, a tiered risk drug matrix and a standardized Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis risk evaluation. RNs followed a standardized workflow to assess patient eligibility and verify treatment clearances. Access to care was reported by numbers of unique patients and treatment visits. Patient appointment adherence was monitored by no-show rates documented in the electronic health record. Infusion reactions and medical emergencies were reported by RNs. Travel miles saved was calculated by subtracting the difference in miles round trip from the patient\u2019s home to main VAMC and from home to CBOC, then multiplied by number of treatment visits to CBOC.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            From October 2021 through April 2024, 23 new CTM clinics opened across 5 regions. 515 unique patients were enrolled for a total of 1,916 patient visits. Treatment appointment no-show rate was 1% across all CTM clinics. The most commonly administered medication classes include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (30%), immune globulin (14.5%), immune checkpoint inhibitors (9.3%) and bisphosphonates (8.3%). Zero infusion reactions or medical emergencies were recorded across 1,430 treatments administered. A total of 204,000 travel miles were saved by patients enrolled in this program.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The CTM cancer care service safely optimizes current VA CBOC infrastructure to increase access points to oncology treatment for patients across various geographical regions. CTM reduced travel burden for patients and increased ability to adhere to treatment appointments as evidenced by the service\u2019s low no-show rate. These consistent results across CTM services at VAMCs nationwide have cemented CTM as a safe and effective treatment delivery model to expand access. CTM will be scaled to an additional 30 regions by end of 2025.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.350","title":["Income, wealth, and debt among families with a history of cancer."],"author":[{"given":"Zhiyuan","family":"Zheng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA"}]},{"given":"Xin","family":"Hu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center and School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA"}]},{"given":"Jingxuan","family":"Zhao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA"}]},{"given":"Robin","family":"Yabroff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Surveillance and Health Equity Science, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>350<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Cancer survivors and their families often experience financial hardship due to high out-of-pocket medical costs and lost income from time away from work during treatment for patients and informal family caregivers. Little is known about detailed income, wealth, and debt among families with a history of cancer.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The 2021 Panel Study of Income Dynamics was used to identify families with a cancer history. Family characteristics included survey response person\u2019s age, sex, marital status, and race and ethnicity, number of dependent children living in the family, and time since cancer diagnosis. For families with multiple cancer diagnoses, time since cancer diagnosis was calculated according to the most recent cancer diagnosis. Family income was assessed by total income in tax year 2020, which consisted of combined taxable and transfer income of the response person, spouse\/partner, and other family members. Wealth with and without equity (i.e., value of home minus mortgage) were assessed by sum of values of different types of assets (e.g. savings, checking, bonds, retirement accounts) net of debts (e.g., credit card debt, student loans, and medical bills).\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            A total of 701 families were identified with a cancer history. Within families, half of cancer survivors were 18-64 years and the other half were &gt;65 years at the survey. About two thirds were married or living with partners, three fourths of response persons were male, one fifth had dependent children living in the same family, two thirds were non-Hispanic white, and two thirds of cancer survivors were diagnosed &gt; 6 years prior to the survey. The median family income was $67,498 (inter-quartile range: $33,480 to $121,200), and the median wealth with and without equity were $188,000 and $5,5000, respectively. Moreover, 29.9% of families had credit debt (median: $4,500; inter-quartile range [IQR]: $1800-$14,000); 11.3% of families carried student loans (median: $4,500; IQR: $15,000-$60,000); and 10.7% of families had outstanding medical bills (median: $4,000; IQR: $2,000-$9,000).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Families with a history of cancer have multiple types of debts, including medical debt, even years after diagnosis.

advances in therapy and the promulgation of multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism teams show great promise to improve management and outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the absence of randomized evidence and lack of consensus leads to tremendous variations in treatment and compromises the wide implementation of new innovations. Moreover, the changing landscape of health care, where quality, cost, and accountability are increasingly relevant, dictates that a broad spectrum of outcomes of care must be routinely monitored to fully capture the impact of modern PE treatment. We set out to standardize data collection in patients with PE undergoing evaluation and treatment, and thus establish the foundation for an expanding evidence base that will address gaps in evidence and inform future care for acute PE. To do so, &gt;100 international PE thought leaders convened in Washington, DC, in April 2022 to form the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative. Participants included physician experts, key members of the US Food and Drug Administration, patient representatives, and industry leaders. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of PE care, the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative was created with representative experts from stakeholder medical subspecialties, including cardiology, pulmonology, vascular medicine, critical care, hematology, cardiac surgery, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, and pharmacology. A list of critical evidence gaps was composed with a matching comprehensive set of standardized data elements; these data points will provide a foundation for productive research, knowledge enhancement, and advancement of clinical care within the field of acute PE, and contribute to answering urgent unmet needs in PE management. Evidence produced through the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative, as it is applied to data collection, promises to provide crucial knowledge that will ultimately produce a robust evidence base that will lead to standardization and harmonization of PE management and improved outcomes.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Circulation"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1161\/strokeaha.124.047232","title":["Stroke of Consistency: Streamlining Multicenter Protocols for Enhanced Reproducibility of Infarct Volumes in Preclinical Stroke Research"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7509-7500","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Gemma","family":"Llovera","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research, Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) University Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany (G.L., S.

A possible factor contributing to this issue is the lack of standardization across experimental stroke models, leading to poor reproducibility in multicenter studies. This study addresses this gap by aiming to enhance reproducibility and the efficacy of multicenter studies through the harmonization of protocols and training of involved personnel.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>METHODS:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We established a set of standard operating procedures for various stroke models and the Neuroscore.

The region has been known to experience massive earthquakes, and several magnitude 6 and 7 class earthquakes have occurred after the network was established in 2016. This study constructed ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for horizontal peak ground accelerations (PGAs) and peak ground velocities (PGVs) using the S-net data and revealed that the GMPEs can be used to predict the PGAs and PGVs at the land stations where measured S-wave velocities are available. We used a relatively short time window of the S-net records from the viewpoint of earthquake early warning but included S waves. Data from earthquakes of magnitudes between Mw 5.5 and Mw 7.4 were used. The construction of the GMPEs was achieved in two steps. First, regression analysis was conducted for each event data, and mean site residual was obtained over the available records at each S-net site. Second, the data were adjusted by the mean site residuals, and stratified regression analysis, which decouples the source and path factors, was performed. Finally, we applied the GMPEs to predict PGAs and PGVs at the KiK-net sites on land. We determined that the residuals at the KiK-net sites were systematically biased with Vs30 (average S-wave velocity in the upper 30 m). We obtained correction factors for the bias and demonstrated that the PGAs and PGVs at the KiK-net sites could be predicted reasonably well.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Disaster Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4990881\/v1","title":["Charging ahead: Firm-level optimisation strategies for sustainable and cost-effective electric vehicle workplace charging"],"author":[{"given":"Marcel","family":"Seger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Christian","family":"Brand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Transport Studies Unit, University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Christoph","family":"Clement","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, University of Bern"}]},{"given":"James","family":"Dixon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}]},{"given":"Charlie","family":"Wilson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford"}]}],"abstract":"<title>Abstract<\/title>\n        <p>Expanding electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is essential for transitioning to an electrified mobility system.

In addition to this, blended oils are quite attractive because of its low dielectric loss and a low ratio of degradation. The present research deals with the\u00a0experimental studies on different insulating oils like mineral oil, synthetic ester oil, coconut oil, blended oils, and nanofluids, which are developed from ZnO and TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nanoparticle doped at 0.01\u202fvol% in different insulating oils through ultrasonication process. In this experiment, the critical properties like electrical and physicochemical properties are examined according to International Electrotechnical Commission and American Society for Testing and Materials standards. Results show that ZnO and TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nano-powder enhances the AC breakdown voltage (BDV), dielectric permittivity, and DC resistivity properties of different insulating oils with improved flash and fire resistance. Remarkably, it is found that mineral oil-based TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nanofluid shows an enhancement of 55.8\u202f% in AC BDV, 9.1\u202f% in permittivity, and 15\u202f% in flash resistance. Moreover, mineral oil based ZnO and TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nanofluid results exhibit remarkable decrement in loss tangent with increased DC resistance property. Finally, it is observed that the influence of TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nano-powder at 0.01\u202fvol% remarkably enhances the electrical and physicochemical properties in different insulating oils compared to ZnO nanofluids. Hence, mineral oil and green insulating based synthetic ester oil (which is based on TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub> nanofluids) have been considered as a potential candidate to make alternatives to traditional insulating oil for power transformer applications. The findings offer critical insights for the future of transformer insulation systems, guiding industry standards and fostering innovation in material science.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Emerging Electric Power Systems"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/ijmr-2023-0228","title":["Effect of different activating agents on carbon derived from <i>Tinospora cordifolia<\/i> for EDLC application"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2669-7400","authenticated-orcid":false,"family":"Komal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Applied Physics , Gautam Buddha University , Greater Noida , Gautam Budh Nagar , UP 201312 , India"}]},{"given":"Kuldeep","family":"Mishra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIT) , Symbiosis International (Deemed University) (SIU) , Pune 412115 , India"}]},{"given":"Yogesh","family":"Kumar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics , Government College, Sec-12 , Palwal , Haryana 121102 , India"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8204-3455","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vivek Kumar","family":"Shukla","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Applied Physics , Gautam Buddha University , Greater Noida , Gautam Budh Nagar , UP 201312 , India"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The effect of two activating agents namely phosphoric acid (H<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4<\/jats:sub>) and iron (III) chloride (FeCl<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>) is investigated, in activation of carbon obtained from <jats:italic>Tinospora cordifolia<\/jats:italic>.

The results of this study reveal that the phenomenon of illegal racing on Chairil Anwar Street, East Bekasi District is a form of freedom of expression by young people. The existence of this group seeks to realize this expression by young people. The freedom they have is applied or realized by modifying the vehicles they have. They create an understanding that is different from the general public, where the group uses motorbikes as a means of expressing themselves, while the general public interprets vehicles as a means of mobility. The process of reinterpreting the use of vehicles for wild racing actors is included in the concept of Bricolage, and the style used is a concept of homology for each individual who is part of this group.

The incidence of anemia in Indonesia is quite high, namely 48.9%. Apart from anemia, the highest pregnancy complication and cause of maternal death in Indonesia is preeclampsia. The cause of preeclampsia is still unknown, but several studies show that risk factors for preeclampsia include maternal age, Body Mass Index (BMI), gestational age, multiple pregnancies, parity, history of preeclampsia, history of hypertension, as well as history of ANC and anemia. to find out more about anemia and preeclampsia which are still the risk factors that have the greatest potential to cause complications and even death in mothers and newborns. Using a literature review study design. Search for articles sourced from the electronic databases Google Scholar and Pubmed with a publication limit of the last ten years. Without enough iron, the body cannot produce hemoglobin to form red blood cells, thus triggering anemia. This causes an increase in the synthesis of corticotrophine-releasing hormone (CRH) due to tissue hypoxia, which then causes uteroplacental insufficiency which results in disruption of the blood supply to the fetus. This is in accordance with the theory of placental ischemia in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Anemia and preeclampsia are interrelated so further research is needed to study both. It is hoped that this literature review article can be used as material for further research in studying the relationship between anemia and preeclampsia in pregnancy.\u00a0Keywords: Anemia, Preeclampsia, Pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0ABSTRAK\u00a0Anemia merupakan kondisi kadar hemoglobin kurang dari batas normal. Angka kejadian anemia di Indonesia tergolong cukup tinggi, yaitu sebanyak 48,9%. Selain anemia, komplikasi selama kehamilan serta penyebab kematian ibu tertinggi di Indonesia adalah preeklampsia. Penyebab preeklampsia masih belum diketahui secara pasti, namun beberapa penelitian menunjukkan bahwa faktor risiko preeklampsia meliputi, usia ibu, Indeks Massa Tubuh (IMT), usia kehamilan, kehamilan ganda, paritas, riwayat preeklampsi, riwayat hipertensi, dan riwayat ANC serta Anemia.

Menggunakan desain studi literature review. Pencarian artikel bersumber dari database elektronik Google Scholar dan Pubmed dengan batasan publikasi sepuluh tahun terakhir. Tanpa zat besi dalam jumlah yang cukup, tubuh tidak dapat memproduksi hemoglobin untuk membentuk sel darah merah, sehingga memicu terjadinya anemia. Hal ini menyebabkan peningkatan sintesis corticotrophine releasing hormone (CRH) akibat dari adanya hipoksia jaringan, kemudian akan menyebabkan insufisiensi uteroplasenta yang mengakibatkan gangguan suplai darah ke janin. Hal ini sesuai dengan teori iskemia plasenta pada patofisiologi terjadinya preeklampsia.

The phylogenetic affinity of Antillean stenostygnines with Stenostygnus Simon, 1879, a genus from the north of South America, is discussed based on some morphological traits.\n\u00a0<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Zootaxa"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1051\/0004-6361\/202451490","title":["The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Dust temperature and physical conditions of the interstellar medium in a typical galaxy at z=5.66"],"author":[{"given":"V.","family":"Villanueva","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"R.","family":"Herrera-Camus","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.","family":"Gonzalez-Lopez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Aravena","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"R.J.","family":"Assef","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mauricio","family":"Baeza-Garay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"L.","family":"Barcos-Munoz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"S.","family":"Bovino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"R.A.","family":"Bowler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"E.","family":"da Cunha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"I.","family":"De Looze","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"T.","family":"Diaz-Santos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"A.","family":"Ferrara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"N.M.","family":"Forster Schreiber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"H.","family":"Algera","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"R.","family":"Ikeda","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Killi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"I.","family":"Mitsuhashi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"T.","family":"Naab","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Relano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.","family":"Spilker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Solimano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Palla","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"S.H.","family":"Price","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"A.","family":"Posses","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"K.","family":"Tadaki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"K.","family":"Telikova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"H.","family":"Ubler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>We present new $ rest =77$ mu m dust continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array of HZ10 (CRISTAL-22). This dusty main sequence galaxy at $z$=5.66 was observed as part of the Resolved Ism in STar-forming Alma Large program (CRISTAL). The high angular resolution of the ALMA Band 7 and new Band 9 data ($ ''.4$) reveals the complex structure of HZ10, which comprises two main components (HZ10-C and HZ10-W), along with a bridge-like dusty emission between them (i.e., \"the bridge\"). Using a modified blackbody function to model the dust spectral energy distribution (SED), we constrained the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) and its variations among the different components identified in HZ10. We find that HZ10-W (the more UV-obscured component) has an SED dust temperature of $T_ SED $sim 51.2$ K; this was found to be sim 5 K higher (which is statistically insignificant; i.e., less than 1sigma ) than that of the central component and previous global estimations for HZ10. Our new ALMA data allow us to reduce the uncertainties of global SED $ measurements by a factor of\nsim 2.3, compared to previous studies. The HZ10 components have (FIR) luminosity ratios and FIR surface densities values that are consistent with local starburst galaxies. However, HZ10-W shows a lower CII \/FIR ratio compared to the other two components (albeit still within the uncertainties), which may suggest a harder radiation field destroying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon associated with emission (e.g., active galactic nuclei or young stellar populations). While HZ10-C appears to follow the tight IRX-$ UV $ relation seen in local UV-selected starburst galaxies and high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, we find that both HZ10-W and the bridge depart from this relation and are well described by dust-screen models with holes in front of a hard UV radiation field. This suggests that the UV emission, which is likely coming from young stellar populations,  is strongly attenuated in the  \"dustier\" components of the HZ10 system.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1051\/0004-6361\/202451427","title":["Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels  to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost"],"author":[{"given":"A.","family":"Khalatyan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"F.","family":"Anders","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"C.","family":"Chiappini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"A.B.","family":"Queiroz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"S.","family":"Nepal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"dal Ponte","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"C.","family":"Jordi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"G.","family":"Guiglion","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Valentini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"G.","family":"Torralba Elipe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Steinmetz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Pantaleoni-Gonz\u00e1lez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"S.","family":"Malhotra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"\u00d3.","family":"Jim\u00e9nez-Arranz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"H.","family":"Enke","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"L.","family":"Casamiquela","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.","family":"Ard\u00e8vol","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>With Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), new and improved astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic measurements for 1.8 billion stars have become available. Alongside this wealth of new data, however, there are challenges in finding  efficient and accurate computational methods  for their analysis. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions from spectro-photometric data. To this end, we built a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor ( xgboost ), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra), without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we used high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic stellar surveys, complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have reported parallaxes. We have achieved median uncertainties of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12&lt;!PCT!&gt;$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeeded in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone or spectral-energy distribution fitting methods we employed in earlier works, especially for parameters $A_V$ and $T_ eff $, along with the metallicity values. Finally, we  showcase some potential applications of this new catalogue, including extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, and extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1161\/strokeaha.124.047483","title":["Decreased Quantitative

In both cases the modeling is done using Gaussian process regression (kriging), and the investigated active-flow-control parameters are the amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle of the actuators that are used to mitigate boundary-layer separation. In the diffuser test case, a parameter-space exploration is conducted to examine the effect of the three input parameters on the amount of reverse flow detected by an array of calorimetric shear-stress sensors. In the airfoil test case, an optimization strategy is followed to maximize an objective function constructed with the airfoil sectional lift coefficient and the mass flow consumption of the actuators. Both experiments consistently indicate that lowering the duty cycle of the pulsed-jet actuators below 0.5 may lead to efficiency gains in active separation control by limiting their mass flow consumption for equal performance, but with a concomitant supply pressure increase.

Consequently, accurately simulating the aerodynamics of propellers operating at negative thrust poses a greater challenge than at positive thrust. This study offers a comprehensive assessment of the aerodynamic modeling capabilities of numerical methods, spanning low to high fidelity, for computing propeller performance across both positive and negative thrust regimes. Low-fidelity methods, namely, blade-element momentum and lifting line theories, effectively predict propeller performance trends at positive thrust. However, they fail to capture trends at negative thrust beyond the maximum power output point due to the neglect of three-dimensional flow effects. Both steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS)\u00a0simulations with [Formula: see text] perform well across both positive and negative thrust conditions, with errors below 2% for both thrust and power magnitudes near the maximum power output point.

However, wall models introduce errors in modeling flow separation, leading to a 16% overestimation of power magnitude near the maximum power output point.

Furthermore, the above time-varying structural dynamics modeling and a fluid\u2013structure coupling interpolation are integrated to construct overall aeroelastic modeling, obtaining a set of differential-algebraic equations. Finally, these equations are numerically solved by the [Formula: see text] method. The proposed approach provides an innovative idea to deal with the incredible complexity of the aeroelastic effect as structural characteristics change over time. It can efficiently and accurately analyze the morphing wing\u2019s transient response or flutter property. To verify and utilize the time-varying aeroelastic modeling approach, numerical calculations and comparative studies were carried out regarding the time-varying characteristics of the structural modes, aerodynamic calculations, and flutter prediction of the morphing wing. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["AIAA Journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.58286\/30295","title":["Developing flaw sizing methodology in Total Focusing Method (TFM) by EDM calibration blocks"],"author":[{"name":"\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure [ETS]","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8772-2078","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mohammad E","family":"Bajgholi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Institut de Recherche d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec (IREQ)","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gilles","family":"Rousseau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"University of Waterloo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Edward","family":"Ginzel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure [ETS]","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9260-1724","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Martin","family":"Viens","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Qu\u00e9bec Metallurgy Centre","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vincent","family":"M\u00e9lan\u00e7on","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\nThe Total Focusing Method (TFM) represents a significant advancement in ultrasonic inspection,\n\ndelivering high-resolution imaging by leveraging phased array technology combined with\n\nsophisticated data processing algorithms.

Despite TFM's\n\ncapabilities, the lack of a standardized methodology for flaw sizing limits its potential for flaw\n\nevaluation. This paper seeks to establish a new paradigm in flaw sizing by introducing a custom\n\nmethodology specifically designed for TFM, using electrical discharge machined (EDM)\n\ncalibration blocks that reflect a range of flaw shapes.

The aim is to contribute further to a limited historical tradition in international tourism geography scholarship. Past tourism in South Africa has attracted some attention from geographers who have demonstrated the relevance of historical research. The paper investigates the emergence of the Ciskei Bantustan (one of ten established under apartheid) as a rural tourism destination in the context of apartheid planning. In terms of the history of Bantustan economic development, the early focus was on industrial development with minimal attention devoted to tourism. A tourism economy did, however, emerge in these areas and given mounting policy attention, particularly from the 1970s and continuing into the post-1981 \u2018independence\u2019 period for Ciskei. The character of tourism development which occurred in \u2018independent\u2019 Ciskei (1981\u20131994) is analysed with particular attention to the growth of casino tourism which was surrounded by controversies about corruption in this rural destination.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Modern Geogr\u00e1fia"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2514\/1.j064382","title":["Influence of Time-Varying Freestream Conditions on the Dynamics of Unsteady Boundary-Layer Separation"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7254-4494","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Francesco","family":"Ambrogi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 2V9, Canada"}]},{"given":"Ugo","family":"Piomelli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 2V9, Canada"}]},{"given":"David E.","family":"Rival","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Technische Universitat Braunschweig, 38108 Braunschweig, Germany"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Unsteady flow separation of a turbulent boundary layer under dynamic pressure gradients is investigated using the Large-Eddy Simulation technique.

Whereas in Case A the freestream-velocity profile changes from suction\u2013blowing to blowing\u2013suction in a complete cycle, Cases B and C are both suction\u2013blowing only and the strength of the adverse pressure gradient is modulated in time. Moreover, the boundary layer in Case B never approaches a zero-pressure gradient condition. A closed separation bubble is formed for all Cases; however, its dimensions change depending on the far-field forcing. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) reveals an advection mechanism of turbulent structures out of the domain for all Cases. Whereas in Case A and C the high-TKE region, generated in the separated shear layer, is washed out of the domain as a rigid body, in Case B the separation bubble remains present and the advection mechanism of TKE is characterized by a breathing pattern. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["AIAA Journal"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1108\/mf-02-2024-0103","title":["Political perspectives and their impact on fintech mortgage lending adoption"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1857-7708","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mohammad","family":"Hashemi Joo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8754-9762","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuka","family":"Nishikawa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the link between political perspectives and the adoption of financial technology (fintech) mortgage lending, a new type of mortgage lending facilitated by online platforms.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title><jats:p>The authors use fintech mortgage lending and presidential election data for the United States of America (USA) counties from 2010 to 2017.

In 2016, SOGI data were listed as required elements in the Uniform Data System (HRSA); however, implementation of this recommendation is inconsistent. The state of New Jersey (NJ) mandated SOGI data collection for patients seen within any healthcare system in NJ to start in June 2023. Jefferson Health (JH), a health system with locations in both Pennsylvania (PA) and NJ, provided SOGI data collection education for its NJ staff. The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) at JH has clinical sites in both states.

Several organizations including NCCN, American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, and ASCO, recommend routine psychosocial distress screening and referral. However, many patients are not routinely screened for psychosocial distress, leading to missed intervention opportunities. The NCCN Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT) is the most commonly used self-reporting tool, but its use varies significantly due to differences in practice, workflows, and resources. This systematic review aims to capture elements of the workflow in screening and referral using the NCCN DT, with the goal of providing building block(s) for the implementation that can be adapted to different settings.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            A systematic review of full-text manuscripts published from 2013 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Studies describing implementation protocols were included. Systematic reviews and commentary articles were excluded. Additionally, studies conducted outside the US, non-English publications, and studies assessing associations of distress scores with disease burden were excluded. Attributes related to the implementation of screening and referral pathways were extracted.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            From an initial screening to 1,219 articles, 12 studies were included in the final analysis. There was variation in the targeted populations, with three cancer centers implementing NCCN DT screening and referral protocols system-wide, while others focused on specific cancer types\/ clinics. Screening was conducted by various personnel, including medical assistants, front-end staff, and nurse\/ nursing assistants, with differences in screening frequency, and mode (paper, telephone, and tablet). Different referral workflows based on distress severity were adopted in multiple studies (n=4), with an array of referral services employed.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The implementation of NCCN DT screening and referral pathways varies across the literature. While standardization is desirable, some variation is essential to accommodate the differing availability of resources and personnel for effective screening and referral. This review identifies foundational blocks and considerations for developing customized NCCN DT screening and referral protocols that align with specific needs and available resources of the practice.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.123","title":["Stereotactic radiosurgery practice patterns for treatment of brain metastases: A large national cancer database study."],"author":[{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Shih","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA"}]},{"given":"Bhav","family":"Jain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Manali I.","family":"Patel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA"}]},{"given":"Kekoa A.","family":"Taparra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>123<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Brain metastases (BM) portend high mortality rates. While whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is a commonly used treatment strategy for BM, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has less neurocognitive toxicity with comparable survival. The objective of this study was to compare treatment practice patterns for SRS vs WBRT using a large national hospital database.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients \u226518 years treated with radiotherapy (RT) for a BM diagnosis between 2004-2020 and with known follow-up. Twelve cancers were included based on highest prevalence: breast, colorectal, kidney\/bladder, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, oral cavity, pancreas, prostate, and thyroid. Patients were grouped by first course RT modality (SRS vs WBRT) confirmed by fraction number (SRS: 1-5; WBRT: 5-15). Multivariable logistic regression assessed predictors of SRS as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Analyses were adjusted for patient and cancer characteristics.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Of 112,232 patients with BM, 30,805 (27%) received SRS. Median age was 64 years. Most patients were White (84%), diagnosed in 2012-2020 (64%), with a higher income (56%), more education (55%), and Medicare\/Medicaid (60%). The most common cancer treated with RT for BM was lung (85%). Patients were less likely to be treated with SRS if they were Korean (aOR=0.68; 95%CI=0.47-0.95), lower income (aOR=0.88; 95%CI=0.84-0.91), lower education (aOR=0.88; 95%CI=0.85-0.91), with Medicare\/Medicaid (aOR=0.86; 95%CI=0.83-0.89) or no insurance (aOR=0.48; 95%CI=0.44-0.53), at a Midwest hospital (aOR=0.79; 95%CI=0.76-0.83; vs Northeast), and at a community (aOR=0.31; 95%CI=0.28-0.33; vs academic) or comprehensive community cancer program (aOR=0.56; 95%CI=0.54-0.58). Patients were more likely to be treated with SRS if they were Asian Indian or Pakistani (aOR=1.41; 95%CI =1.08-1.85), older (aOR=1.01; 95%CI=1.01-1.01), diagnosed in 2012-2020 (aOR=3.92; 95%CI=3.78-4.07; vs 2004-2011), lived farther from the hospital (aOR=1.00; 95%CI=1.00-1.00), and received chemotherapy (aOR=1.17; 95%CI=1.13-1.21).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In one of the largest BM studies with over 110,000 US patients, disparities in SRS treatment patterns were identified.

Darolutamide (DARO) is a structurally distinct &amp; highly potent ARI approved for nmCRPC based on ARAMIS (phase 3). There are no prospective comparative clinical trial data for DARO vs enzalutamide (ENZA) &amp; apalutamide (APA). DEAR (NCT05362149) compared real-world (RW) utilization, tolerability &amp; outcomes of ARIs in 870 patients (pts) with nmCRPC.

Key outcomes include time to initial ARI discontinuation, reason for discontinuation, time to metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) progression, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) &amp; treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). ARI utilization &amp; tolerability were compared using descriptive frequency statistics; time-to-event outcomes were compared using unadjusted Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates &amp; Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline characteristics.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Of all 1375 pts meeting eligibility criteria, 565 (41%) received DARO, 609 (44%) ENZA &amp; 201 (15%) APA. During the study, the number of pts with nmCRPC initiating ARI treatment decreased annually but the proportion starting DARO increased vs ENZA &amp; APA. Baseline characteristics were generally similar across treatment groups; median follow-up was similar for DARO (26.2 mo), ENZA (26.2 mo) &amp; APA (25.5 mo). Median time to discontinuation was not reached (NR; 95% CI 35.5\u2013NR) for DARO, 27.6 mo (23.9\u201335.6) for ENZA &amp; 26.8 mo (22.6\u201342.8) for APA. Adjusted HRs showed significant discontinuation risk reductions for DARO vs ENZA (27%) &amp; vs APA (31%) (Table). The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were TEAEs (DARO 10%, ENZA 15%, APA 15%) &amp; disease progression\/death (15%, 19%, 18%, respectively). Adjusted HRs for mCRPC progression showed significant risk reductions for DARO vs ENZA (37%) &amp; vs APA (28%) (Table). Times to discontinuation &amp; mCRPC progression were similar for ENZA &amp; APA. PSA response, OS &amp; MFS rates were numerically higher for DARO vs ENZA &amp; APA.

patients with bone metastases. Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but difficult to treat adverse event of BMAs. There are known patient and treatment related risk factors for development of ONJ, however, little is known on social and geographic risks. In patients with bone metastases and concurrent MRONJ, we seek to describe differences in patient's geographic residence (rural versus urban) with other social factors as secondary outcomes.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We conducted a retrospective chart review of Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center patients in the date range of 01\/01\/2013 to 11\/01\/2023. Included were patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer or multiple myeloma who had a diagnosis of MRONJ. We recorded Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes, the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), age, race, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol use, body mass index, insurance status, type of cancer, type of BMA, and cumulative dosing of BMAs. Patients were defined as rural or urban based on criteria from the health resources and services administration website. Relative socioeconomic advantage versus disadvantage was determined by the patients\u2019 ADIs with a decile rank from 1-10 for state ADIs and a percentile rank of 1-100 for national ADIs. SAS software (version 9.4) was used for data analysis (2023, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            A total of 88 patients met inclusion criteria. 64% of patients lived in urban areas and 36% in rural. Demographic features of the identified patients are listed in table 1. MRONJ patients from both urban and rural areas had an above average national and state ADI, with a trend toward higher ADIs in rural locations compared to urban locations; mean of 6.7 vs 5.3 state ADI and mean 70.6 vs 62.0 national ADI, for rural and urban patients respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between rural and urban patients in any of the demographic or health-related characteristics we examined.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patients with bone metastases and MRONJ in our cohort demonstrate relative socioeconomic disadvantage in comparison to national and state averages. In comparing the rural with urban patients, however, we observed relatively similar profiles.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:caption

Prior to implementation of a digital closed-loop referral system, community resources were not centralized, and knowledge of resources varied between clinic staff within a community cancer center treating patients throughout the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Referrals to community-based organizations (CBO) were found in the electronic health record as unstructured data and were difficult to track manually. As an organization, the medical care team needed to identify top sought HRSNs to better understand health equity needs in our community.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            2023 Q1: Partnered with Findhelp, a social needs closed-loop referral platform. 2023 Q2-4: Attended Findhelp train-the-trainer education and began building a customized oncology database of local, regional, and national resources. Developed a process to log community-based referrals, update the referral status, and close the referral loop within Findhelp for individual patients. Educated and trained support services staff. 2024 Q1: Utilized Findhelp data analytics to review and evaluate closed-loop referral system and top sought HRSNs.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            We describe our results to date (Table).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Digitizing community resources and establishing a closed-loop referral process between the community cancer center and CBOs allowed accurate data tracking and increased access to data to ensure patients\u2019 needs were met. After eight months, financial toxicity, housing insecurity, and food insecurity were identified as the top three sought HRSNs. In the future, increased data will help evaluate gaps in resources and leverage stronger relationships with CBOs to meet patients\u2019 HRSNs in a community cancer center.\n

of a patient\u2019s life is consumed by health care. This number of contact days are especially relevant for older adults with advanced cancer facing limited survival. One concern is that patients with different sociodemographic and clinical backgrounds may be at particular risk of increased contact days. Thus, there is a critical need to understand factors associated with contact days.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We linked data from 6 SWOG trials in advanced cancer to Medicare claims data. These trials encompassed a variety of primary cancer types [prostate (S9916, S0421), lung (S0003, S0124, S0819), and pancreas (S0205)]. Health care contact days (days with ambulatory, emergency department, inpatient, or facility-based care) in the first 12 months were calculated using Medicare database files. A day with &gt;1 source of contact counted as 1. We examined sociodemographic (age, race, ethnicity, sex, insurance status, rurality, area deprivation index) and clinical (prognostic risk, cancer type, performance status) predictors of contact days, using negative binomial regression, with a log link and clustering by study ID, including an offset variable for duration of observation. We examined predictors in univariate and multivariable analysis. We report relative risk (RRs) estimates and 95% CI.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            We included 1,429 patients (median age, 71 years, 7.6% Black, 2.7% Hispanic, 21.4% female, and 23.5% rural residence). Of these, 741 (51.9%) patients died in the first year. The median number of contact days was 48, out of a median of 350 days of observation. At a trial level, median percentage of contact days ranged from 14% (prostate) to 27% (lung). The most common sources of contact days were ambulatory clinician visits (median=17), tests (median=12), and treatments (median=11). In multivariable regression, factors associated with increased contact days included increasing age (per year, RR=1.02 [1.01-1.02], p&lt;.001), insurance status (Medicare alone or with Private or Medicaid insurance, vs Military\/VA, none, or other insurance, RR=2.47 [2.16-2.83], p&lt;.001), higher prognostic risk score (RR=1.14 [1.04-1.25], p=.004), and type of cancer (pancreas, RR=1.69 [1.51-1.89] and lung, RR=1.69 [1.54-1.85] vs prostate, p&lt;.001 for both).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            This novel linkage of trial and claims data to evaluate contact days and associated factors found that older trial participants spent up to one in four days with health care contact. Ambulatory appointments were the most common source of contact days. Encouragingly, rural residence and neighborhood deprivation were not associated with contact days, increasing confidence that participants from diverse geographic areas may receive equitable care in trials. These data highlight the frequency of contact days for trial participants, while identifying factors to consider when benchmarking contact days.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.14","title":["Oncology care model cost data for breast, lung, and multiple myeloma: Influence of outpatient rehabilitation therapy services."],"author":[{"given":"Mackenzi","family":"Pergolotti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Select Medical, Mechanicsburg, PA"}]},{"given":"Kelley C.","family":"Wood","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Select Medical, Mechanicsburg, PA"}]},{"given":"Siraje","family":"Mahmud","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Dallas, TX"}]},{"given":"Justin","family":"Adams","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Dallas, TX"}]},{"given":"Shumeye","family":"Mamo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Dallas, TX"}]},{"given":"Tiffany","family":"Kendig","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Select Medical, Machanicsburg, PA"}]},{"given":"Ashley N.","family":"Lightner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Select Medical, Mechanicsburg, PA"}]},{"given":"Stacye","family":"Mayo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Select Medical, Mechanicsburg, PA"}]},{"given":"Sabrina Q.","family":"Mikan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Austin, TX"}]},{"given":"Kathryn Elizabeth","family":"Hudson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Austin, TX"}]},{"given":"Terry Lynn","family":"Jensen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Texas Oncology, Dallas, TX"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>14<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            High value cancer care is defined by access to coordinated, appropriate healthcare services that achieve optimal outcomes at a reasonable cost. Evidence supports outpatient cancer rehabilitation (physical, occupational or speech therapy) as a mechanism to improve outcomes such as health-related quality of life, suggesting that integration of these services is beneficial for cancer survivors. However, the impact of outpatient rehabilitation services on healthcare costs is unknown. We aimed to compare cost segments between those who attended community-based outpatient rehabilitation therapy services (Rehab) versus those who did not (Non-rehab). We hypothesized that healthcare costs would be lower for the Rehab group in the following cost segments: emergency department (ED), part D drugs, home health services, skilled nursing facility services (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), and hospice.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            This is a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries who received chemotherapy at a large community oncology practice that participated in the oncology care model (OCM) program from 2018 to 2021. Two data sources were linked, OCM cost data and the rehabilitation medical record. This yielded sufficient sample sizes for analysis of breast, lung, or multiple myeloma (MM) cancer types. Rehab cases were then matched to Non-rehab cases 3:1 based on cancer type, stage, and sex. Cost variables included total cost of care (TCOC) and cost segments using OCM methodology. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistic (p&lt;.05) was used for analysis.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Cases (N=3,033) primarily had early-stage cancer (0 to 2, 74.8%) and were 70.4\u00b17.3 (Rehab) or 71.6\u00b18.5 years old at diagnosis (Non-rehab). Most had breast cancer (81.2%), followed by lung cancer (11.7%) and MM (7.2%). TCOC was $32,387 and $26,257 for the Rehab and Non-rehab groups, respectively. Costs were significantly lower for the Rehab group in five of the six segments analyzed; IRF costs were lower, but not statistically significant (Table).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the influence of real-world, outpatient cancer rehabilitation therapy services on the cost of cancer care. Community-based therapy services were associated with significantly lower costs in ED, part D drugs, home health, SNF, and hospice segments. Future studies examining rehabilitation services as a relatively low-cost supportive care option to meet patient needs and enhance high-value care are warranted.\n            <jats:table-wrap

propelled a rapid shift to telemedicine use, including patients with advanced cancers needing palliative care (PC). Yet, little is known about disparities in telemedicine use for PC. We leveraged population-based data to examine the trend and factors associated with telemedicine use for PC among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with advanced cancers during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We identified patients aged \u226565.5 years diagnosed with advanced-stage breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung (NSCL), small cell lung (SCL), pancreas, and prostate cancers in 2015-2019 from the SEER-Medicare data. We included those with continuous fee-for-service coverage and had any PC claims from diagnosis to death, hospice admission, or by 12\/31\/2020 (whichever came first). Telemedicine was identified using procedure codes, modifiers, and place of service codes on PC claims. We described the percent of PC recipients using telemedicine each quarter in 2019-2020. Multivariable logistic models assessed patient and provider characteristics associated with telemedicine use among PC recipients in 2020.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Telemedicine use for PC was 0.24% to 0.48% across 4 quarters in 2019, which increased to 16.3% in Q1 and stabilized at about 30% in Q2-Q4 in 2020. Among 2,945 PC recipients in 2020, 22.5% used telemedicine. Older patients (75-84 years and 85+ years) were 4.4 percentage points (ppts) and 8.6 ppts (p-values&lt;0.05) less likely than patients ages 65-74 years to use telemedicine. Patients who were female (4.4 ppts), residing in higher socioeconomic status areas (Yost Quintile 5 vs 1: 7.7 ppts), treated by female providers (4.1 ppts), in hospital system (3.7 ppts vs. individual physician office) and organizations with hospice and palliative care specialists (8.9 ppts) were more likely to use telemedicine for PC (all p-values&lt;0.05). (Table).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Telemedicine use for PC surged during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with considerable disparities by patient sociodemographic and provider characteristics. These disparities suggest potential barriers related to patients\u2019 technology literacy and internet access, provider awareness, and healthcare organization resources. Future mixed-method studies need to elucidate these barriers to design interventions at patient, provider, and system levels to ensure effective PC delivery.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:caption content-type=\"mtgabstract-table-title\">\n                <jats:p>Selected factors associated with telemedicine use for palliative care.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:caption>\n              <jats:table content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                <jats:thead content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom align-left\" rowspan=\"1\"\/>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">Absolute Probability Difference (95%CI)<\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:thead>\n                <jats:tbody>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Age group (ref: 65-74)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"\/>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">75-84<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">-4.4 (-7.6, -1.2)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">85+<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">-8.6 (-13.4, -3.7)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Female (ref: Male)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">4.4 (0.9, 7.9)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Yost quintile (ref : Q1-Q2)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"\/>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Q3-Q4<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">2.2 (-1.7, 6.1)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Q5<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">7.7 (3.3, 12.1)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Hospital system (ref: Individual physician office)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">3.7 (0.6, 6.7)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Provider: Female (ref: Male)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">4.1 (0.7, 7.5)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Organization with hospice and palliative care specialists<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">8.9 (5.4, 12.4)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:tbody>\n              <\/jats:table>\n            <\/jats:table-wrap>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1542\/pcco_book246_document005","title":["You Code It!

COLONTOWN (CT) is a virtual colorectal cancer community providing peer support and evidence-based education for both caregivers and patients. As such, we sought to understand caregivers\u2019 involvement related to treatment decision making and care delivery, and related gaps in support.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Our online anonymous survey was posted in May 2024 to members of CT\u2019s international caregiver community, who may be more active in their patients\u2019 care than typical of the broader CRC population. It included 33 questions on caregiving responsibilities, effect of cancer on other life activities, impacts, support received\/needed and 13 demographic questions. We identified a subset of 9 questions specifically related to treatment that are reported here.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            All data was self-reported based on their patient\u2019s time in active treatment. Of 359 respondents, 88% were female and 86% significant others\/spouses. Their patients were 90% Stage IV and 85% in the US with 17 other countries represented. Caregivers nearly always participate in and often have primary responsibility in treatment-impacting activities (Table). This includes researching treatment options, where among the 69% in a primary role 31% have complete responsibility, managing side effects, and recording and reporting symptoms. 88% were always or usually at appointments and\/or otherwise in direct contact with the care providers. Caregivers' roles, however, are not always recognized by their patient\u2019s care team. Only 6% felt completely supported and 21% felt completely respected by their patient\u2019s care team. 66% felt \u201cEnhanced communication and collaboration with healthcare providers\u201d would aid in their role in patient care. 56% indicated \u201cmore education resources for caregivers\u201d are needed.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Caregivers report assuming primary responsibility in many critical activities in patient treatment. The gap in recognizing this dynamic contributes to the challenges of caregiving. CT embraces the vital role of caregivers by offering dedicated caregiver resources and engaging them as equal partners in development and offering of all programs . Acknowledgement of the depth of the caregiver role is needed and more caregiver support should become a standard component of the patient\u2019s care plan. Any shared decision-making processes and education should appropriately recognize and include caregivers as critical stakeholders as requested by their patient.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:caption content-type=\"mtgabstract-table-title\">\n                <jats:p>Caregivers\u2019 reported role in treatment-impacting caregiving activities.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:caption>\n              <jats:table content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                <jats:thead content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom align-left\" rowspan=\"1\">Activity<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">Primary Role %<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">Split Evenly %<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">Support Role %<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">No Role %<\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:thead>\n                <jats:tbody>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Researching treatment options<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">69<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">13<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">17<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Researching\/managing side effects<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">64<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">21<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">14<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Symptom reporting<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">47<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">24<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">23<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">6<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Coordinating care<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">44<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">27<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">25<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">4<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:tbody>\n              <\/jats:table>\n            <\/jats:table-wrap>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.121","title":["Further assessment of structural and social determinant of health effects on breast cancer care timelines: A qualitative study."],"author":[{"given":"Risha","family":"Sheni","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"}]},{"given":"Danielle","family":"Tomer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"}]},{"given":"Dana","family":"Watnick","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY"}]},{"given":"Della F.","family":"Makower","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care, Bronx, NY"}]},{"given":"Anjuli M","family":"Gupta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Montefiore Medical Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Vikas","family":"Mehta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>121<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Time to treatment (TTI) delays result in increased morbidity and mortality for cancer patients. These treatment delays disproportionately occur within marginalized communities due to structural challenges with social determinants of health (SDoH), disengagement with the healthcare system and limited or low health literacy that impacts their ability to obtain timely, appropriate care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients treated for breast cancer about their care treatment trajectories to further understand barriers and facilitators for timely treatment from the patient perspective.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 patients in 2023 who received curative intent breast cancer treatment at Montefiore Medical Center from 2019 to 2023. Interviews addressed barriers and facilitators of timely TTI, perceived timeliness and salience of timeliness, emotional well-being, and perceptions of the healthcare team and communication. We analyzed interviews using framework analysis.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            A total of 30 patients were interviewed (mean age 58.9 year \u00b1 10.6, 75% Non-Hispanic Black, 25% Non-Hispanic White). The median TTI was 52.5 days (49, 62 IQR). First treatment modality included surgery (75%) and chemotherapy (25%). Many participants found significant emotional and logistical support through family, social networks, religion, and connecting with survivors. Several patients faced transportation issues hindered their ability to adhere to schedules, childcare challenges, and difficulty managing numerous appointments, with some wishing transportation services had been offered at diagnosis. Some participants experienced unique cancer presentation, required clearances, involvement of non-oncologic providers and consultants, and time for decision-making about treatment options that may have contributed to delays. Some patients faced financial burdens including personal expenses, family support needs, and difficulties accessing third-party assistance (i.e., short-term disability, Supplemental Security Income). Some patients valued mental health counseling and other resources like group therapy and social workers, though some wished for earlier, more specialized support, indicating gaps in the support timeline. A few patients expressed preference for longer TTI that afforded them time to make important decisions and seek opinions.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The study revealed that many patients faced logistical, emotional, and informational challenges while awaiting treatment and highlighted a need for more tailored assistance and timely interventions.

While cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for cancer-related insomnia, it remains underutilized due to its limited accessibility. To date, we are unaware of any study that has investigated the implementation of CBT-I in routine clinical care. Our prior work showed that a stepped care approach, combining a web-based CBT-I and 1-3 booster therapy sessions, was not significantly inferior in producing sleep improvements than a standard 6-session CBT-I. The main goals of the IMPACT (Insomnia in Patients with Cancer \u2013 Personalized Treatment) program are to assess the feasibility and efficacy of implementing this stepped care CBT-I in four cancer centers in Quebec City, Canada.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The ongoing study uses a stepped wedge cluster non-randomized design implementing the stepped care CBT-I at various time intervals across cancer centers. All first-line cancer providers (e.g., nurses, oncologists, radio-oncology technologists, pharmacists) are met every 3-4 months to present\/remind them of the rationale of the project and procedures to refer patients to the IMPACT program. Patients having a score \u2265 4 on the sleep item of the Edmonton System Assessment System-Revised (ESAS-R-sleep) receive a leaflet explaining the stepped care CBT-I and how to access the web-based program (first step). Patients with residual insomnia symptoms after completing this first step are offered 1-3 booster sessions with a clinical psychologist (second step). Uptake and retention rates are the main variables.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Across cancer centers, 11.9%-50.8% of patients having a score \u2265 4 on the ESAS-R-sleep item were referred to the IMPACT program. The most common reasons for not referring were: 1) the presence of comorbid anxiety or depression symptoms (they were referred instead to the psychosocial oncology team) and; 2) patients declining help. Registration rates were greater when a brief follow-up phone call was conducted to explain the IMPACT program in more detail (vs. giving only the leaflet). Across cancer centers, 10%-54.9% of referred patients registered with the web-based CBT-I, 83.3%-90% of them initiated it and 26%-42.3% completed it. The most common reasons for not completing the web-based CBT-I were: 1) sleep difficulties improved or remitted (36.2%); and 2) the program did not meet patients\u2019 needs (23.4%). Among completers, 29%-56% had residual insomnia and were offered booster sessions. On average, sleep diary data collected during treatment (N=83) indicated a reduction of sleep-onset latency of 20 min and of wake after sleep onset of 45 min.

Recently, studies have shown the correlation between socioeconomic neighborhood deprivation (ND) and post-operative quality of life (QoL) in oncologic surgeries. We sought to examine the impact of preoperative QoL and ND with postoperative sequela following RC.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            This was a prospective IRB approved study of patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer from 2021 to 2023. QoL was assessed with the FACT-Bl-Cys survey. Clinicopathologic, complication, and readmission data were collected up to 90 days, as well as distance from the hospital and 4 zip-code based Indices (1-100 index scores representing socioeconomic deprivation). FACT-BL-Cys and indices scores were correlated with outcomes of interest. Pairwise Spearman correlation was done between indices and QoL Instruments. A multivariable analysis (MVA) identified the factors that influence complications and readmissions.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The cohort consisted of 56 patients, mostly men (n=40, 71%). Median age was 69, most had organ-confined disease (\u2264(y)pT2N0M0, n =45, 80%) and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=32, 57%). 75% underwent a continent diversion (neobladder n=38, 68% or continent cutaneous diversion n=4, 7%). Median follow-up time was 10.1 months (range 3.7 - 16.7 months). No correlation was observed between 30\/90-day complications or readmissions with FACT-BL-Cys. Healthy Places Index (HPI) correlated with overall QoL and subscores. On MVA, correlation was seen between Social Deprivation Index (SDI) and 90-day readmissions (p=0.03, OR=0.97, 95%CI= 0.94-0.99).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patient-reported QoL aligns with diverse socioeconomic strata, as per deprivation indices, which in turn correlate with readmissions. Further studies are needed to understand the relationship between patient reported QoL and ND with postoperative outcomes.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n

high-quality cancer care, impacting patient outcomes. Factors such as geographic location, transportation infrastructure, and socio-economic status contribute to variations in patient travel distance. The relationship between patient travel distance and the area deprivation index (ADI), a measure of socioeconomic disadvantage (based on income, education, employment, and housing quality) and social vulnerability of neighborhoods developed by the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA), remains largely unexplored. This abstract seeks to unveil the intricate relationship between patient travel distance and ADI, shedding light on the impact of social vulnerability on cancer care access.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Using patient ZIP code data and practice location data from April 2023 to March 2024, we calculated the straight-line, one-way, patient-clinic travel distance (travel distance). We then derived the ADI for patient ZIP codes using geospatial mapping techniques and compared travel distances by area deprivation vulnerability categories.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            While analyzing geographic data for 20,000 patients at 5 locations, we observed that 89% of patients traveled 15 miles or less one-way to reach the practice location, with a median travel distance of 5 miles. Median travel distance in miles for patients within 15 miles of each practice location by ADI vulnerability category is provided (Table). Median travel distances between ADI categories were statistically significant (Kruskal Wallis H-test, p &lt;0.001). Patients from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods generally travel longer distances to access cancer care.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patients in socially vulnerable locales generally travel longer distances to access cancer care. By considering the ADI alongside patient travel distance, healthcare providers and policymakers can understand barriers faced by disadvantaged populations and allocate resources to reduce disparities in access to care. Targeted interventions and policies, like improving transportation services\/infrastructure, empowering community-based care locations, and expanding telehealth, are necessary to address travel distance disparities for vulnerable populations. The effects of increased travel distance on timely access to care, treatment adherence, health outcomes, finances, caregivers, and patient satisfaction warrant further investigation.\n

interacting with the health care systems, is particularly important for patients with limited life expectancy. Little is known about the relative impact of time toxicity among different cancer types at the end of life. This study examines median contact days for inpatient, outpatient, and home health services among different primary cancer types for patients with advanced cancer with limited prognosis.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on patients with advanced (stage 4) cancer who died within one year of diagnosis at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2023. Time toxicity was defined as comprehensive contact days with healthcare system over the course of patients\u2019 survival period between cancer diagnosis and death (i.e., contact days divided by survival or contact %). Types of contact included institutional stay (emergency department visit, hospitalization, skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation); outpatient visits (ambulatory care, labs, imaging); and in-home care (home-health, home hospice, telephone and virtual visit). The study quantified overall median contact % and contact % by specific care settings, stratified by cancer primary site.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The study included 10102 patients. The median age at diagnosis was 74 years with 47% female. Patients were predominantly white (65%), followed by Asian (12%), Hispanic (12%), and black (8%). The median Elixhauser comorbidity score was 4. With the exception of head and neck cancers, most cancers had higher contact % near diagnosis and at end of life (U-shaped curve). Head and neck cancers had the highest percent of patients undergoing surgery (36%) and radiation (52%), which may explain its sinuosity-like curve with a rapid increase of weekly contact % after diagnosis (a small peak), followed by rapid decrease and another increase by the end of their life. Survival days were comparatively long for head and neck cancers (158 days, IQR: 84-265) and short for thoracic (80 days, IQR: 35-166) and upper gastrointestinal cancers (80 days, IQR: 38-173). Malignant hematology patients had notably higher comprehensive contact % (74%, IQR: 47-100) which was driven primarily by emergency room department visits and hospital stays (p&lt;0.001 for all contact types).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The study highlights the high burden of time toxicity in patients with advanced cancer with limited prognosis. The significant variations in time toxicity among different cancer types, especially in malignant hematology and head and neck patients, emphasize the need to tailor goals of care discussions for patients with cancer at the end of life. By focusing on reducing unwanted time toxicity, healthcare providers can enhance the quality of life for patients with cancer, ensuring more efficient and patient-centered care delivery.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.140","title":["Impact of screening on mortality for patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at a safety-net hospital: An opportunity for addressing disparities."],"author":[{"given":"Vedaamrutha","family":"Reddy","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT"}]},{"given":"Kalyani","family":"Narra","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"Madison","family":"Hull","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UNTHSC Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"Kari","family":"Teigen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"Jolonda C","family":"Bullock","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"John Peter Smith Hospital, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"Riyaz","family":"Basha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"Nadia","family":"Alawi-Kakomanolis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"John Peter Smith Health Network, Fort Worth, TX"}]},{"given":"David E","family":"Gerber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX"}]},{"given":"Timothy J","family":"Brown","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>140<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer with a rising incidence in the US. HCC almost always develops on a background of chronic liver disease, which disproportionately affects individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES), perpetuating existing disparities. Compounding these disparities, individuals of lower SES are less likely to participate in recommended cancer screening exams. Here, we describe the outcomes of patients diagnosed with HCC at a large urban safety-net hospital primarily serving the underserved.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We identified patients diagnosed with HCC at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas from January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2021 to determine the impact of screening on survival. Patients were allocated to the screened cohort if they had undergone liver imaging within one year prior to HCC diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank test were used to illustrate and compare 3-year survival curves from an index date of diagnosis until death. Cox proportional hazards model were used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Lead time bias was adjusted in a sensitivity analysis using the Duffy adjustment and a sojourn time of 70 days and 140 days.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            A total of 158 patients were included (n=53 screened, n=105 unscreened). The mean age was 62 years; 144 (91%) had cirrhosis, 78% were male, 34% were non-Hispanic white, and 8.2% had private insurance. Those in the unscreened cohort had more severe liver dysfunction (as measured by the ALBI grade) and produced higher levels of AFP, but were less likely to have cirrhosis than the screened cohort. The median overall survival (OS) for the screened cohort was 19.0 months (95% CI: 9.9-NA) and 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.7-8.5) in the unscreened cohort (HR death (unscreened v screened) = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.6-3.6; log rank\n            <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.0001). After adjusting for ALBI grade, AFP, hepatitis C, insurance status and initial treatment, there was a statistical difference in hazard of death in the three years (HR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5-3.6), favoring the screened cohort. The benefit for screening remained after adjusting for lead-time bias. With a mean sojourn time of 70 days, the HR death was 2.19 (95% CI 1.4-3.3,\n            <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\n            =0.0002) and was 2.09 (1.4-3.2,\n            <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\n            =0.0005) with a 140-day sojourn time.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In an urban safety-net population, screening for HCC was associated with improved outcomes compared to patients with incidentally-diagnosed HCC. Altogether, this implies that earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment can positively improve survival for patients with newly diagnosed HCC in a population of patients evaluated at a safety-net hospital. Development of screening programs in accordance with accepted guidelines with outreach to high-risk individuals represents an area of high value care for safety-net hospitals.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.72","title":["Assessment of social determinants of health (SDOH) in patients with non-metastatic cancer: Real-world evidence from a large geographically representative community oncology network."],"author":[{"given":"Andrew Joseph","family":"Osterland","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Ontada, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Yunfei","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Ontada, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Thomas W.","family":"Wilson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Population Health Impact Institute, Loveland, OH"}]},{"given":"Jessica K.","family":"Paulus","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Ontada, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Gregory","family":"Patton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Ontada, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Kashif Alam","family":"Firozvi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Maryland Oncology Hematology, US Oncology Network, Silver Spring, MD"}]},{"given":"Kaushal","family":"Desai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>72<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Understanding the impact of SDOH is essential for addressing health disparities in early detection and cancer care.

Patients were indexed at earliest diagnosis in The US Oncology Network between 1\/1\/17 and 6\/30\/22 andfollowed through 6\/30\/23. SES was measured using the state area deprivation index (ADI). Disease stage was assessed within 90 days of initial diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier analyses of TTMd were conducted by tumor type.

Of patients with available data, mean (SD) age was 64.8 (13.0) years, 84% were White, 5% were Hispanic, 6% had Medicaid, and 25% resided in the least deprived ADI quintile (Q1). Disease stage (% of N available) and median (95% CI) TTMd in months for tumors with observed variations by SDOH are presented overall, by race and by ADI (Table). Increased risk of TTMd was observed among higher (more deprived) ADI (Q5 vs. Q1: adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.21, P&lt;0.01; Q4 vs. Q1: aHR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, P&lt;0.01) and Black race (vs. White: aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14, P&lt;0.01).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In this analysis of SDOH in 109,935 US patients with non-metastatic cancer, Black race and lower SES were associated with more advanced disease at first visit and higher risk of metastasis or death.

focusing on providing care that maximizes comfort, dignity, and personal satisfaction during the final stages of life. Residents are primarily involved in Goals of care (GOC) discussion in hospitalized patients it is an integral component in Internal Medicine (IM) resident education. Literature has shown improved outcomes in delivering bad news by residents and oncology fellows after workshops, lectures, and courses. We aimed to improve Residents' competency in effective GOC discussion.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We devised a questionnaire with the help of palliative care specialists and distributed it via a Google survey to the IM residents. After the survey, a palliative care specialist lectured about understanding the POLST form and components of Code Status Discussions. The same questionnaire was sent again. Five survey questions were used as post-lecture improvement parameters, and residents were stratified among three different classes: Interns, Year 2, and Year 3.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Before the lecture, residents were asked about their comfort level on a scale from 1-10, with 10 being the most comfortable conducting GOC discussions with the patient or the patient's family. As per the combined survey of all three classes, 50% of residents scored seven or above. Post lecture, 69.3% of intern year residents and 100% of 2nd and 3rd-year residents scored seven and above, which showed significant improvement in residents' comfort level while conducting GOC discussions. The parameters analyzed were the ability to explain SPIKES protocol for 'Breaking Bad News. Initially, 58.3% of the residents were comfortable explaining it, while 41.7 % answered negatively. After the survey, 84.6% from the intern year, 92.3% in 2nd year, and 77.8% of 3rd-year residents stated being comfortable with explaining SPIKES protocol. Another evaluated paradigm was the residents' ability to determine the patient's prognosis using any given scale\/score (like the UCSF prognosis calculator). 33.3 % of the residents said 'yes' while 30.6% answered 'maybe.' Post-intervention, 100% of 3rd-year residents and 61.5% of 2nd-year residents, while 30.8% of intern-year residents said 'yes.' The cumulative mean of all three combined classes was 64.1%, which showed significant improvement compared to pre-intervention 33.3%.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The results show that residents' comfort level of conducting GOC discussions improved with a single lecture on the topic. Further interventions and mentorship are needed. Intern-year residents were found to have a lower level of subjective comfort in conducting these discussions, which can be explained by their being relatively new to the work environment. A more integrated approach at the beginning of the residency training regarding GOC discussion training can improve interns' confidence and comfort for ensuing such discussions.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.161","title":["Services to address food shortage concerns among people undergoing cancer treatment in the US."],"author":[{"given":"Alejandro Roberto","family":"Marrero Gonzalez","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC"}]},{"given":"Anna","family":"Crawford","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Hollings Cancer Center, Charleston, SC"}]},{"given":"Andrea","family":"Incudine","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Family Reach Foundation, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Carla","family":"Tardif","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Family Reach Foundation, Boston, MA"}]},{"given":"Evan Michael","family":"Graboyes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>161<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            In line with recommendations from cancer research and advocacy organizations, including ASCO, there has been an increased interest in addressing food insecurity (FI) among people with cancer, and recent clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of food-specific services (e.g., food delivery programs, food vouchers) on FI and clinical outcomes in this population. However, non-food-specific services (e.g., education, financial assistance) may be used by community-based organizations to promote food security and address the underlying financial strain. To date, little is known about the nature and distribution of services to address FI from community-based organizations for people with cancer undergoing treatment.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            This cross-sectional study included adults undergoing cancer treatment from 2020-2023 who had food shortage concerns and received services from Family Reach, a national cancer support organization that provides support to people with cancer undergoing treatment. The primary outcome was supportive service to address food shortage concerns, which were categorized as either food-specific (i.e., food pantry, food delivery) or non-food-specific (i.e. financial assistance, resource navigation). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with receiving food-specific services.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Among 4166 adults with cancer undergoing treatment who had food shortage concerns, the median (IQR) age was 45 (18) years; 41.4% identified as non-Hispanic white, and 68.2% were female. The most common cancer types were breast (32.3%) and hematologic (23.0%). Overall, 100% with food shortage concerns received non-food-specific services and 24.2% received both non-food specific services and additional food-specific services. The most common food-specific services were referrals to food pantries (16.9%; 704\/4166) and food delivery programs (14.1%; 585\/4166). The most common non-food-specific services were a stipend for financial assistance (43.2%) and resource navigation with tailored referrals for patients\u2019 needs (37.9%). On multivariable analysis, People living in a dual unemployment household (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74) and people whose preferred language was Spanish (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.96) were less likely to receive food-specific services to address their food shortage concerns, while people with Medicaid health insurance were more likely to receive food-specific services than those with private insurance (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.66).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In a large nationwide financial support organization serving people with cancer, food shortage concerns are managed with a combination of food-specific and non-food-specific services.

To address disparities, we co-developed the Addressing Latinx Cancer Care Equity Study (NCT04843332), a multi-level intervention with community stakeholders. ALCANCE was designed for low-income and Latinx adults with cancer in rural Monterey County, California. We provided annual training for clinicians about testing guidelines and precision medicine disparities. Trained CHWs educated patients about precision medicine and encouraged them to raise the topic with their oncologist. We tested whether the intervention improved patient knowledge and receipt of precision medicine.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent cancer, age \u2265 18 years, able to consent in English or Spanish, and who self-identified as a racial and ethnic minority OR low-income status OR were insured by public or agricultural company insurance OR uninsured and receiving cancer care at Pacific Cancer Care, a rural community oncology practice in Monterey County, were randomized 1:1 to usual care (control group) or usual care augmented with the multi-level intervention for 12 months (intervention group). The primary outcome was whether the multilevel intervention could increase patient knowledge of precision medicine using a validated 6 question survey from time of enrollment (baseline) to 6-months post-enrollment between groups. A secondary outcome was receipt of precision medicine. CHWs and clinicians completed semi-structured interviews.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            110 participants were randomized; 70% (n = 67) reported Spanish as their primary language; 81% (n = 89) identified as Hispanic.

Most had gastrointestinal (35.5%, n = 39) and breast (24.5%, n = 27) cancers and were diagnosed with stage 3 or 4 (64.5%, n = 71) disease. Precision medicine knowledge was low at baseline across both the control and intervention groups (23.5 \u00b1 19.3 versus 23.0 \u00b1 17.7, respectively). Intervention group participants had greater precision medicine knowledge at 6-months (39.2 \u00b1 23.0) than control group participants (24.2 \u00b1 20.0) with greater increase in knowledge overtime than control group participants (p &lt; 0.001). More intervention group participants (n=46, 79.3%) received precision medicine testing than control (n=34, 60.7%). Across both groups, 26 of those tested had an actionable mutation.

Current ASCO guidelines recommend olanzapine or prochlorperazine for refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea. However, there is a lack of direct empirical comparisons to establish their relative efficacy.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The URCC NCORP Research Base and 21 NCORP practices enrolled 1,363 chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with breast cancer starting a high\/moderate emetogenic chemotherapy regimen to this Phase III RCT (NCT03367572). Antiemetics were prescribed per ASCO guidelines. Screening occurred during Cycle 1, followed by randomization for Cycle 2. Those with \u2265 moderate nausea (\u22653 on a 1-7 scale) in Cycle 1 and willing to continue were randomized (1:1:1 ratio) into 3 arms (n=310): 1) ASCO regimen plus olanzapine (OLZ), 2) ASCO regimen plus prochlorperazine (PC), or 3) ASCO regimen plus placebo. Nausea was evaluated using a four-day home diary (4x daily), with the primary outcomes being changes in average (avg) and maximum (max) nausea. FACT-G measured QOL. Intent-to-treat primary analyses (ANOVA and Cohen\u2019s \u0394 effect size) evaluated whether OLZ or PC improved nausea, testing between-arm differences in nausea change from Cycle 1 to 2 compared to placebo at a p=0.025 significance level corrected for 3 arms.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The median age was 50.7y, with 80.7% White\/12.3% Black\/5.8% Asian\/4.2% Latino, and evenly distributed across groups. The change in avg nausea score was statistically significant for the OLZ (avg change = \u22121.07: Cohen\u2019s \u0394 = 0.49) and PC arms (avg change = \u22120.94: Cohen\u2019s \u0394 = 0.38) compared to the placebo (avg change = \u22120.50; p &lt;0.001 vs OLZ, p = 0.01 vs PC). Similar but larger changes were noted for change in max nausea score in the OLZ (max change = \u22122.57: Cohen\u2019s \u0394 = 0.86) and PC arms (max change = \u22122.01: Cohen\u2019s \u0394 = 0.47) against the placebo (max change = \u22121.30; p &lt;0.001 vs OLZ, p &lt;0.01 vs PC). The OLZ arm had a clinically significant change in overall QOL from pre-chemo to Cycle 2 vs placebo (FACT-G mean difference = +4.91; p = 0.006) but the PC arm vs placebo did not (FACT-G mean difference = \u22120.87; p = 0.61).

Prior research suggests that physical pain and illness perceptions each impact important health behaviors. This retrospective study utilized a brief geriatric screen to examine the relationships between pain levels, activities of daily living (ADLs), and perceptions of overall health for older adults with breast cancer. Implications for methods to improve the patient experience for this population are considered.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The Senior Adult Oncology Program (SAOP) screening tool was administered to 429 patients age 65 or older at a breast oncology clinic. A total ADL score was computed by summing patient-reported responses to 13 ADL items, such as ability to dress oneself, feed oneself, and remember to take medications. A higher ADL score indicates greater difficulty with these responsibilities. Pain was assessed using a 10-point scale; scores were dichotomized to form a low-pain group (scores 0-4) and high-pain group (scores 5-10). Overall Health was assessed on a 1-10 scale, with higher scores indicating perceptions of greater health. Demographic and medical information was abstracted from patients\u2019 electronic health records. Independent samples t-tests examined differences between the high-pain and low-pain groups in total ADL score and self-assessed Overall Health.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The average age of the sample was 76 years old (range = 65-89 years). Approximately half of the sample identified as White (48%); 20% identified as Black. In comparing the high-pain and low-pain groups, the high-pain group reported significantly greater difficulty with ADLs (M score = 3.25, 1.41, respectively; p=.026). Additionally, patients endorsing high pain levels reported significantly worse Overall Health as compared to patients endorsing low levels of pain (M= 7.50, 6.11, respectively; p=.001).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Older adults with breast cancer experiencing high levels of pain demonstrated greater difficulty with ADLs and worse perceptions of overall health. It is critical that pain is assessed early and often for older adults with breast cancer. Early identification of high pain levels in this population could allow those in need to receive pharmacological and\/or behavioral treatments for pain, which may maintain stability or promote improvement in ADLs and perceptions of one\u2019s health. Incorporating brief pain assessments into future geriatric screening tools could improve the process of aging during and after breast cancer.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.366","title":["Opioid tapering and discontinuation for head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors."],"author":[{"given":"Talya","family":"Salz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Akriti","family":"Mishra Meza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Natalie","family":"Moryl","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Anuja","family":"Kriplani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Kathryn Ries","family":"Tringale","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"James","family":"Flory","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Patrick T","family":"Bradshaw","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA"}]},{"given":"Sankeerth","family":"Jinna","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]},{"given":"Allison","family":"Lipitz-Snyderman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>366<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Older HNC survivors often experience post-treatment pain, and they fill opioid prescriptions more often than similar cancer-free adults for the first 5 years after HNC diagnosis. To better understand whether ongoing opioid use is likely explained by continued opioid prescribing from the time of cancer treatment, we aimed to quantify the extent to which opioids prescribed near the end of treatment are reduced in dose (tapered) and discontinued after treatment completion.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and Medicare claims data, we identified adults age &gt;65 diagnosed 2014-2017 with stage I-III HNC with \u22656 months treatment-free follow-up prior to censoring at further treatment, new cancer, hospice, 3 months prior to death, or end 2019. We evaluated the presence of a new or ongoing opioid prescription 2 weeks following treatment completion (baseline) and calculated daily baseline dose in morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Among those with an opioid prescription (\u201con opioids\u201d) at baseline, we described cross-sectional metrics of opioid receipt and dose every 30 days: proportion of survivors on opioids (who were also on opioids the prior month), initial and current dose of opioids for those currently on opioids, and proportion of survivors on opioids whose dose declined \u226550% from baseline.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Among 5135 HNC survivors, 894 were on opioids at baseline (average daily dose 44 MME). By 1 month, 29% of survivors on opioids at baseline (N=260) had a current opioid fill, and 7% had an opioid dose &lt;50% of the baseline dose. Discontinuation of opioids increased each month; median daily dose each month ranged from 44 MME at 30 days to 60 MME at 180 days. Those who remained on opioids over 6 months had the highest opioid dose than those who discontinued earlier (median 45 MME at 90 days; Table).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            About 1 in 6 HNC survivors had an opioid prescription filled at the end of cancer treatment, and opioids were generally discontinued within a few months. Given the low median dose at baseline, the limited evidence of tapering likely results from low initial opioid doses rather than a failure to taper from long-term or high-dose use. Opioid use among older treatment-free HNC survivors that is apparent years after treatment completion is unlikely to result from inadequate tapering. Instead, it may be due to new or worsening cancer-related pain, as well as to non-cancer pain.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:caption

Differences by group were assessed using the chi-squared test with Rao &amp; Scott\u2019s second-order correction. Cox-proportional hazards models tested associations between nativity\/citizenship status and cancer-specific (CSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM), adjusted by age, gender, and survey year.

Intervention: Azole-antifungals (fluconazole*, voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole) will be held the day before, day of, and day after the vinca-alkaloid administration (with flexibility given provider discretion*) in the outpatient and inpatient setting at a single site.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), informational technology (IT) processes such as Best Practice Advisory (BPA), nursing orders, Vinca Time-Out order and standard nursing note template for telephone encounter to remind patient\/parents.

The CDx clinic prioritizes expedited cancer evaluation, timely and accurate diagnostic testing, and transition of care to subspecialty Oncologists, to improve the patient experience and cancer-related outcomes.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Leaders in the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) initiated a pilot project to facilitate timely appointments to Oncologists for patients in the Emergency Department with a new suspected cancer. Patient access lead time and time to diagnosis and treatment were tracked. This pilot was formally expanded across the health system to become the CDx clinic for eligible adult patients with suspicious symptoms, lab abnormalities, or imaging findings concerning for cancer. Patient data was extracted using an EMR-based form and supplemented by chart review. Study period was March 2023 to April 2024 and included socio-demographics, cancer subtype, referral type, time from referral to new patient appointment (access lead time), time from first appointment to diagnosis and treatment (surgery, systemic or radiation therapy), patient retention, complications, and mortality.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Over 12 months, 108 patients were evaluated in the CDx clinic. Most patients were male (56%), White (58%), and non-residents of Philadelphia County (65%). There were 8 referrals (range: 6-13) per month with the majority of patients from external referrals (60.2%). Compared to baseline, CDx resulted (median pre\/post in days) in similar time to first appointment (7 vs. 7 days), improved time to diagnosis (21 vs. 8 days), and improved time to treatment (42 vs. 29.5 days). 71 patients were diagnosed with cancer with Gastrointestinal (47%) and Thoracic (24%) cancers being most common. 98.6% (70\/71) of patients were retained at ACC and transitioned to subspecialty care. 80.3% (57\/71) of patients received cancer-directed treatment. After the initial consult date, for the patients diagnosed with cancer, there were 4 ED visits and 20 hospitalizations within 30 days, 19 hospice enrollments, and 16 deaths.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The CDx clinic has been a valuable resource for patients with suspected cancer by optimizing time to diagnosis and time to treatment.

Participants were recruited via 1) email invitation to participants at a correctional health conference, 2) purposeful sampling using targeted emails to clinicians in prison systems selected for diversity in size, geography and correctional health model (e.g., contracted care), and 3) snowball sampling of individuals from research and participant networks. Participants were interviewed about 1) logistics of cancer care delivery from screening and treatment through end-of-life care, 2) barriers and facilitators to cancer care delivery, and 3) evidence-based strategies to facilitate cancer care in prisons, including best practices.

Participants reported prison clinicians coordinate most cancer care (e.g., screening, diagnosis and symptom management), while cancer treatment largely occurs in community or academic facilities outside of prison. Common barriers identified included underscreening \/ delays in diagnosis, complex logistical coordination, poor communication (between patients and oncologists, and prison clinicians and oncologists), inadequate symptom management, dehumanizing practices, loss-to-follow-up after release and that patients often come from marginalized populations. Common facilitators were better access to insurance, cancer screening, and general medical and cancer care than incarcerated patients might receive before\/after incarceration. Participants identified multiple ways to improve cancer screening (creating enforceable standards, increasing continuing medical education, implementing electronic medical record reminders, reducing logistical barriers), cancer treatment (implementing navigators within prisons and cancer centers, prioritizing care with oncologist input, keeping care in prisons, decarceration), and transitions to the community (Medicaid activation prior to release, community partnerships to facilitate care transitions).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Incarceration imposes multiple barriers to cancer care delivery, but clinicians identified numerous tools to improve cancer care in prison.

However, implementation of UDS in oncology clinics is underreported.

Patients were included if their first UDS was collected during the year prior to (pre-intervention) or during the 12 months after (post-intervention) opening of the embedded Thoracic Onco-Palliative Clinic on September 5, 2018. In the pre-intervention period, UDS was routinely ordered for only patients referred to a standalone palliative care clinic. This 2-step UDS includes immunoassay and chromatography-based testing followed by interpretation of results by a specialty-trained palliative care clinical pharmacist. In the post-intervention period, UDS was expanded to include any patient seen by Thoracic Medical Oncology regardless of palliative care referral status. A Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were used to compare time to first unexpected UDS between cohorts.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            More patients had UDS testing in the post-intervention (n = 182) versus pre-intervention (n = 61) period.

The number of UDS tests per patient was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in the post-cohort (mean (SD): 2.4 (2.7)) vs. pre-cohort (1.5 (1.3)). A larger proportion of pre-cohort patients completed only one UDS during the study period (pre: 73.8% (45\/61); post: 53.3% (97\/182); p &lt; 0.01). In the post-cohort, 58 (31.9%) patients completed UDS ordered by oncology team prior to palliative care referral compared to 0 patients in the pre-cohort; 29 (21.4%) patients completed UDS without receiving outpatient palliative care compared to 0 patients in the pre-cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves for the pre- and post-cohorts were similar during the first 6 months of drug screening (p = 0.7) and diverged after 6 months, with a higher probability of detecting an unexplained UDS in the post cohort at 24 months (Pre: 15.0%; Post: 40.0%).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Implementation of confirmatory UDS in a thoracic oncology clinic facilitates closer monitoring for nonprescribed substance use during opioid management and continued detection of unexpected UDS results up to 24 months.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.213","title":["\u201cTell me I\u2019m okay\u201d: A cross-sectional quality-of-life assessment of patients in a breast cancer survivorship program."],"author":[{"given":"Muna","family":"AlKhaifi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Universtiy of Toronto, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada"}]},{"given":"Elwyn","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada"}]},{"given":"Sarina","family":"Sadeghi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>213<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            The number of breast cancer survivors is increasing due to improvements in care and an aging population, leading to an increased need for care that addresses the physical and psychological needs of patients after completion of active treatment. The Sunnybrook Breast Cancer Survivorship Program was established to provide comprehensive evidence-based survivorship care and facilitate the transition to family doctors. Despite rising interest in dedicated survivorship care, there is little consensus regarding which individuals are likely to suffer the most long-term impacts of breast cancer treatment. Factors as varied as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and treatment type can influence Quality-of-Life (QoL) outcomes. This cross-sectional assessment uses mixed methods to evaluate QoL trends in the patient cohort.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Current patients of the Sunnybrook Breast Cancer Survivorship Program were asked to complete a baseline information form, as well as the EORTC QLQ-30 and BR-45, two validated measures of QoL for breast cancer patients and survivors. QoL, functional, and symptom domains were calculated from these responses accordingly and analyzed statistically. Patients reported their most bothersome QoL concerns through an open-ended questionnaire, which was analyzed and organized thematically. 99 patients have been recruited to date, of a planned 200.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            We find that sexual health is of importance for this population, with 50 (50.5%) participants reporting sexual activity. Patients under 50 have poorer sexual functioning scores (p&lt;0.01) as well as more issues with body image (p&lt;0.05) than older survivors. Both married and under-50 patients are significantly more likely to have poorer outlooks on the future (p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01). Younger patients also tended to have worse role functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning scores, though these differences were not statistically significant. Thematic analysis of qualitative data showed that patients\u2019 chief concerns were the impact that ongoing side effects had on their daily functioning, impact of treatment on body image, disruptions to work and personal relationships, and strong anxiety about potential recurrence.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            While it is understood that younger BC survivors face unique challenges, our findings indicate that these obstacles persist into older age groups. In addition to physical side effects, such concerns as body image issues, social strain, and emotional functioning can drive QoL scores for these patients. Notably, many patients endorsed strong anxiety regarding potential recurrence that affected QoL, and identified dedicated survivorship follow-up as an ameliorating factor. Further research should be conducted into the unique needs of under-50 survivors, as well as the role of recurrence anxiety in impacting QoL.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.276","title":["Systemic anti-cancer treatment and healthcare utilization at end of life: A SEER Medicare analysis."],"author":[{"given":"Kerin B.","family":"Adelson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Maureen","family":"Canavan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT"}]},{"given":"Jiangong","family":"Niu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Hui","family":"Zhao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Nico","family":"Nortje","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Jenny Jing","family":"Xiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Sharon H.","family":"Giordano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]},{"given":"Lee","family":"Cheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>276<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Use of chemotherapy at end-of-life (EOL) is associated with adverse quality of life, higher costs, increased hospitalizations (HL), emergency department (ED), and intensive care unit (ICU) utilization and lower hospice (HP) use.

EOL SACT was defined as SACT received within 30 days of death, categorized as combination chemo-immunotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. We analyzed associations between EOL SACT use (overall and by type), and healthcare utilization in the last 30-days of life (ED, HL, ICU, and HP) with chi-square tests and multivariable regression, controlling for sociodemographic and cancer covariates.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Of 499,607 beneficiaries, 37,595 (7.5%) received SACT within 30 days of death.

   ASCO and Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) released a statement on increasing racial\/ethnic equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in cancer trials (1). It included recommendations for clinical practices and research sites to 1) screen every patient for trial eligibility; and 2) routinely collect and analyze screening and enrollment data by patient demographic characteristics, including race\/ethnicity. Most of the 62 sites that completed a 2021 pilot study reported that screening data were not readily available by patient race\/ethnicity (2). ASCO conducted a follow-up study about challenges, resource needs, and effective strategies for collecting and analyzing these data.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Semi-structured interviews were conducted with research team members from sites that completed the 2021 pilot study. Sites were purposefully selected based on pilot study data quality and insights, diversity of patient population, and site type, size, and region. Sites completed a pre-interview questionnaire on site characteristics and screening and enrollment processes before participating in a 1-hour interview focused on challenges and effective strategies for collecting and analyzing screening and enrollment data, by race\/ethnicity. Anticipated themes and relationships, stemming from the pilot study findings, informed a conceptual framework. Up to 20 interviews were planned and halted sooner when there was theme saturation.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Thirteen research sites participated in the study, representing academic centers (62%) and community-based practices\/health systems (38%) with racially\/ethnically diverse patient populations (median 31% non-white; range 11% to 63%). 53 research team members participated in the interviews (typically 4 per site), including investigators (23%), directors\/managers (56%), and coordinators (21%). Aggregated responses were interpreted through content analysis and concepts were quantified for both frequency and extensiveness. Several barriers to patient screening, data collection, and analysis were cited, including lack of standardized procedures and documentation, dedicated staff and time, quality and\/or accessible data on race\/ethnicity and\/or screening, and integrated technology that facilitates screening and documentation.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Collecting and analyzing screening and enrollment data are critical to identifying and mitigating racial\/ethnic disparities in trial access and EDI. Many sites do not systematically screen every patient for a trial and\/or document outcomes. Lack of resources, including dedicated staff and time and integrated technology, make it difficult for them to do so in systematic and reliable ways. Greater investment in resources will help to facilitate routine screening of every patient and ensure underrepresented populations are not being overlooked for trials. 1.\n            <jats:uri xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1200\/JCO.22.00754?cmpid=rm_jco_heqty_accc_press_email_media_051922_051922_t6__aware_text_\">Oyer et al, JCO, 2022<\/jats:uri>\n            . 2.\n            <jats:uri xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/10.1200\/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.6530\">Pressman et al, JCO, 2022<\/jats:uri>\n            .\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.384","title":["The association of oncology telehealth visits with acute care events and follow-up appointments."],"author":[{"given":"Jennifer","family":"Elston Lafata","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Ilona","family":"Fridman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Alan C.","family":"Kinlaw","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Lauren C.J.","family":"Jordan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Samantha","family":"Tam","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Henry Ford Health, Detroit, MI"}]},{"given":"Angela B.","family":"Smith","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"William Allen","family":"Wood","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Jacob Newton","family":"Stein","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Matthew","family":"Dunn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, Chapel Hill, NC"}]},{"given":"Christine","family":"Neslund-Dudas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Henry Ford Health, Detroit, MI"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>384<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Use of telehealth visits in cancer care expanded with the pandemic, yet few studies have assessed its impact on subsequent care outcomes. We evaluated differences in acute care events (ACEs) and follow-up visits among patients with telehealth compared to in-person oncology visits.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We identified a cohort of adults with an upcoming oncology visit related to their cancer treatment at two academic medical centers (in central NC and southeast MI) and their community affiliates. Black adults and those with a scheduled telehealth visit were oversampled. Pre-visit surveys administered by telephone collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, prior telehealth use, health status\/symptoms and travel distance. We joined survey and electronic health record (EHR) data and used geocoding to assign census-tract-level community characteristics to participants. ACE and follow-up visit use were ascertained via the EHR. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence differences in ACEs within 30 and 180 days as well as follow-up visits within 7 and 30 days were assessed by visit type.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            502 patients were study eligible, 90 telehealth and 412 in-person visits. In unadjusted and adjusted models, the proportion of patients incurring an ACE within 7 and 30 days was not significantly different (6 vs. 3% and 17 vs. 10%, telehealth vs. in-person, respectively). Nor did the proportion of patients having a follow-up visit within 7 or 30 days differ significantly (26 vs. 20% and 65 vs. 54%, telehealth vs. in-person, respectively). Some patient characteristics were similar regardless of visit format. For example, most patients were older (63 mean age SD 13), not currently employed (66%), and reported getting by\/living comfortably with current income (88%), having some college education (80%), no transportation troubles (85%), and activated patient portal accounts (89%). Symptom presentation per the PRO-CTCAE was similar between groups as was broadband connectivity. Telehealth patients were significantly less likely to be Black (14 vs. 44%), female (48 vs. 72%), have breast cancer (22 vs. 48%), received chemotherapy (72 vs. 83%), or to live within 60 minutes of care (49 vs. 68%), and more likely to have advanced disease (24 vs. 14%), report LGBTQ sexual orientation (10 vs. 4%), and be married (70 vs. 57%).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Similar ACE and follow-up visit use among those with telehealth and in-person visits supports the idea that telehealth could be a viable substitute for some in-person care within oncology. Differences between those using telehealth and in-person visits highlight equity concerns and missed opportunities to enhance patient convenience and other aspects of care access. To better understand telehealth\u2019s impact, not only on care use, but other indicators of quality (including patient outcomes), matching via propensity score analyses are needed and underway.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.166","title":["A collaborator-engaged approach to tailoring strategies for implementing systematic health-related social needs assessment: Results from a cross-center study."],"author":[{"given":"Sarah","family":"Birken","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC"}]},{"given":"Jennifer J.","family":"Gabbard","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC"}]},{"given":"Andrea","family":"Nederveld","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO"}]},{"given":"Katharine A.","family":"Rendle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"}]},{"given":"Rinad S.","family":"Beidas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL"}]},{"given":"Callie","family":"Walsh-Bailey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL"}]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Blumenthal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"}]},{"given":"Robert A.","family":"Schnoll","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"}]},{"given":"Aliza","family":"Randazzo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC"}]},{"given":"Cheyenne","family":"Wagi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC"}]},{"given":"Jenna","family":"White","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA"}]},{"given":"Kristie","family":"Foley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>166<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            Health-related social needs (HRSNs) exacerbate inequities in cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality. To improve health equity, policymakers recommend systematic HRSN screening in oncology clinics. In preliminary studies, we found low rates (&lt;10%) of HRSN screening in oncology. Building upon these findings and transdisciplinary expertise across four Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control (ISC3), in the current study, we engaged oncology care teams in tailoring site-specific strategies to implement HRSN screening.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Centers varied in collaborator engagement methods, including Context-Driven Co-Design (CD2), which aims to harmonize the intervention (i.e., HRSN screening), context (e.g., oncology clinic), and implementation strategies. First, site leads conducted semi-structured interviews with 8-10 care team members and clinic observations to identify current HRSN assessment processes and opportunities and barriers to systematic HRSN screening. Second, site leads engaged collaborators in one-on-one interviews or, when using CD2, in 3-4 iterative co-design workshops in which they used context assessment data and user-centered design activities (e.g., storyboarding) to prioritize contextual factors, identify necessary adaptations to HRSN screening, and co-design implementation strategies to address salient barriers. Centers met monthly to share knowledge and troubleshoot.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Most Centers\u2019 oncology clinics had established informal HRSN screening approaches. Across Centers, collaborators (e.g., providers, nurses, medical assistants, patients) identified similar opportunities (e.g., desire for a standardized approach to HRSN screening; well-functioning clinical teams and physical space). Common challenges included limited familiarity with HRSN screening and documentation tools; lack of standardized screening protocol; and limited awareness of HRSN screening\u2019s purpose. Implementation strategies included pencil-and-paper screening tools; clinic signage regarding HRSN screening\u2019s purpose; training and creation of standardized screening protocol; and a centralized resource for responding to HRSN with adjustment, assistance, alignment, and\/or advocacy.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Four ISC3 Centers developed multicomponent implementation plans tailored to their oncology clinic. Centers\u2019 varied approaches and timelines presented challenges and opportunities for cross-Center learning. Oncology clinics exhibited substantial overlap in opportunities and challenges in HRSN screening. Much of CD2\u2019s benefits were related to its collaborator-driven approach to implementation strategy development. Next steps include deploying implementation plans and assessing their impact on equitable reach and adoption of HRSN screening and response to identified needs.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.28","title":["Navigating financial risk: Unlocking the power of modeling and risk quantification in episode-based payment models."],"author":[{"given":"Puneeth","family":"Indurlal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]},{"given":"Jason","family":"Altieri","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"McKesson, The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]},{"given":"Hope Ives","family":"Thomas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]},{"given":"Jessica louise","family":"Neeb","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]},{"given":"Stuart George","family":"Staggs","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]},{"given":"Lalan S.","family":"Wilfong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"The US Oncology Network, The Woodlands, TX"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>28<\/jats:bold>\n          <\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Background:<\/jats:bold>\n            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation\u2019s (CMMI) Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM) is a voluntary value-based care (VBC) model that requires physician group practices (PGPs) to assume financial risk and performance accountability for episodes of care related to seven common cancers. However, PGPs often lack the means to assess the financial impact and risks associated with these alternative payment models. To address this, we employed Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) to calculate the likelihood of outcomes and associated risks. This information can assist PGPs in making informed decisions about assuming risk and participating in the EOM.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Using historical episode files from 2019 to 2022 for 23 PGPs in The US Oncology Network, along with the EOM Price Prediction Model provided by CMMI, we calculated the predicted baseline price and savings per episode. We then determined the average savings for each PGP per time-period and utilized the MCS technique to simulate savings and risk, under each EOM risk arrangement. We shared the simulation results with the PGPs to support their decision-making process and participation.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            Despite having enough episodes per time-period (ranging from 105 to 6100) for the 23 PGPs, the limited number of time-based populations (only 6) based on case mix and patient volume made traditional probability assessments inadequate. To overcome this, we utilized MCS with 5000 simulations per PGP, assuming a normal distribution based on population characteristics. By assessing the savings outcomes of each simulation, we developed probability distributions and confidence intervals to determine the likelihood of generating shared savings, recoupment, or landing in the neutral zone within the EOM. Factors such as episode counts, baseline price, and risk arrangement had the greatest impact on the range of outcomes. We shared the MCS results with all 23 PGPs, highlighting the limitations of the original data and facilitating their decision-making process. Ultimately, 12 PGPs chose to assume risk based on the probability of financial outcomes with the model, and to select the appropriate risk arrangement in the EOM.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Compared to the status quo measures of central dispersion, MCS yields a wide range of expected financial outcomes per PGP. MCS is a robust technique for quantifying outcome probabilities in VBC models despite low data volumes but relies on the representativeness and quality of the original data. Conducting sensitivity analysis with MCS to assess the impact of individual assumptions or data inputs on outcome probabilities is an area for further exploration.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1542\/pcco_book246_document001","title":["Endocrinology: Updated <i>ICD-10-CM<\/i> Diabetes and Hypoglycemia Codes"],"author":[{"name":"American Academy of Pediatrics","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This article reviews code changes that will be implemented for services on and after October 1, 2024.

Radon testing is attainable for these communities, but the cost of one-time mitigation is high and out of reach for many. The University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) partnered with the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of the Mohican Nation (S-M) Health Center to test homes for radon levels and mitigate (repair) those structures when levels were high to mitigate a structural barrier of health. Prior tests had suggested 10% of homes across Wisconsin test \u201chigh\u201d for radon (above 4 pCi\/L). The mean radon level among tested homes in Wisconsin is 5.7 pCi\/L (American Lung Association, Radon Testing Disparities: Wisconsin, 2022).\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            The project was co-developed with the UW and S-M. A key partner was the Wisconsin Radon Program, housed at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. We aimed to educate, test for radon, and mitigate all homes that tested high for radon. Education, promotion of the program and testing were done in collaboration between state, university, and tribal officials. The environmental health and community health coordinators at S-M was the key person for distributing and ensuring the return of kits. Mitigation was performed by a private certified contractor over the project. We used descriptive statistics to evaluate the percentage of Wisconsin homes that tested high for radon in our sample. We also surveyed community members about their satisfaction with the mitigation contractor.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            This project was done from April 2023 to April 2024. Staff reported educational sessions were successful in improving their knowledge of radon and testing and mitigation procedures. The S-M had 1822 enrolled tribal members at the start of the study. A total of 85 kits were distributed, with 64 returned (75.3% return rate). Of those, 42 of 64 tested positive for high radon in the home (65.6%), much higher than the expected 10% positive rate. The mean radon level among all homes was 14.1 pCi\/L (0-111.6pCi\/L) and 18.7 pCi\/L among homes that tested positive. All homes testing high have completed radon mitigation. All reported their homes could not have been mitigated without this collaboration. The community was satisfied with the services of the certified contractor.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Radon levels were much higher than anticipated in Native lands in Wisconsin and may explain higher rates of lung cancer.

Patients had a median age of 63 years, were 63% female and 58% White and 68% had gastrointestinal cancers. Though no patient had a documented SIC, patients and their oncologists often disagreed about whether an undocumented SIC had occurred previously (Table). Patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 reported barriers to SICs included patient factors (lack of readiness, desire to maintain hope, focus on the present), clinician factors (perceived discomfort with prognostic disclosure and SICs), and prognostic uncertainty (current disease control, unpredictable prognosis). Patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 reported facilitators to SICs included patient- (self-advocacy, SIC readiness), clinician- (comfortable rapport), disease- (progression, worsening symptoms), and family-related facilitators (advocates for the patient to engage in SICs). To increase SICs, patients and caregivers reported greater acceptance of interventions involving a personal touch (e.g. phone call) over automated processes. Oncologist survey responses were brief. They reported SICs were most frequently triggered by disease progression or treatment intolerance, and recommended longer appointment times and written materials to facilitate SIC.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Patient, caregiver and oncologist feedback on barriers and facilitators to SICs provided useful insights to improve interventions to encourage SICs.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:caption content-type=\"mtgabstract-table-title\">\n                <jats:p>Patient\/oncologist dyad (n=16) concordance of prior SICs.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:caption>\n              <jats:table content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                <jats:thead content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom align-left\" rowspan=\"1\"\/>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\"># of dyads<\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:thead>\n                <jats:tbody>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Agreed SIC occurred<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">7<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Agreed SIC did not occur<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">2<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Only oncologist reported SIC<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">6<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Only patient reported SIC<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">Total patient\/oncologist dyads<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">16<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:tbody>\n              <\/jats:table>\n            <\/jats:table-wrap>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.222","title":["Disparities in mental health screening for veteran women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer."],"author":[{"given":"Nicole Margo Grogan","family":"Fleege","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA"}]},{"given":"Stephanie","family":"Bunt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA"}]},{"given":"Bradley","family":"Mecham","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Iowa City VA Health Care Syst, Iowa City, IA"}]},{"given":"Andrea","family":"Holcombe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Iowa City VA Health Care System, Iowa City, IA"}]},{"given":"Jeffrey","family":"Quinlan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University Of Iowa, Iowa City, IA"}]},{"given":"M.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in this population and up to 50% of women will experience depressive symptoms after diagnosis, associated with poor prognosis and survival. An increasing number of Veteran women live in rural areas, where access to behavioral health care may be limited. This study sought to evaluate rural disparities in mental health screening and follow-up evaluation after a new BC diagnosis.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Women Veterans with a new BC diagnosis were identified between 2017 and 2021. Data for mental health screenings [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2, PHQ-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7] were collected subsequent to the first BC diagnosis. Rurality was defined per the USDA Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes framework to determine rurality based on population density and commuting patterns. Data were abstracted from several large VA and non-VA datasets, including the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) Outpatient files, non-VA Care Medical and Pharmacy System files, Program Integrity Tool, and VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure for Oncology. Rurality data was specified using CDW designations combined with ZIP-code-level USDA RUCA information. All categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Means were tested using t-tests.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            14,225 Veteran women with a new BC diagnosis were identified. The mean age was 63.4 (SD 11.7). The most common documented race was White (30.6%), followed by Black (15.7%). 59.6% lived in an urban setting as opposed to rural setting (40.4%). In the entire population, only 14% had a mental health screening within 3 months of a cancer diagnosis. Veteran women living in an urban setting were more likely to be screened compared to those living in a rural setting (17.4% vs 9.2%, p &lt; 0.001). For women screened within 3 months, most screened negative, regardless of rurality (76.1% rural, 75.7% urban). Of women who had a positive mental health screen within 3 months, only approximately one-third (31.8% rural, 34.2% urban) had additional screening regardless of rurality. However, for those with a negative initial screen, urban Veterans were more likely to have any additional screening (17% vs 10.2%, p = 0.001). PHQ-2 was the most common mental health screening tool used (73.8%) followed by a combination of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (9.6%).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Mental health screening within 3 months of breast cancer diagnosis is low for Veteran women. There is a significant difference in screening between rural and urban populations. It is critical to both improve mental health screening overall in this population and bridge the disparity gap between screening in rural and urban Veteran women. This may impact not only mental health but also breast cancer outcomes during the period encompassing treatment and survivorship.\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1200\/op.2024.20.10_suppl.66","title":["Racial representation in multicenter clinical trials leading to drug approvals for gynecological cancer indications by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."],"author":[{"given":"Kristen R.","family":"Ibanez","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Women\u2019s Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD"}]},{"given":"Maheen","family":"Khan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Center for Immuno-Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD"}]},{"given":"Duncan","family":"Donohue","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Statistical Consulting and Scientific Programming Group, Computer and Statistical Services, Data Management Services, Inc.

However, there is limited data evaluating how recruitment sites in international clinical trials contribute to racial representation, specifically in Gyn cancers. Here, we examined racial enrollment and geographic location in clinical trials that have led to approval for Gyn cancer applications.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            Agents approved by the FDA for Gyn cancer treatment and corresponding clinical trials were identified from the FDA Drug Approvals and Databases. Enrollment data were abstracted from ClinicalTrials.gov then cross-checked with published manuscripts and FDA labels. Using Gyn disease site prevalence from the 2021 SEER database, we calculated expected enrollment proportions by race and compared these to actual clinical trial enrollment data. The binomial test was used to compare expected vs. observed proportions with White patients as the reference group.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            From 2014 to 2024, 9 drugs received 22 FDA approvals for ovarian (n=13), endometrial (n=4), or cervical cancer (n=5). These approvals were based on 28 clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,763 patients (75.7% White, 3.4% Black, 12.0% Asian, 8.9% Other\/Unknown). These trials included 1 (3.6%) US only study, 3 (10.7%) non-US, primarily Europe-based studies (PAOLA-1, AURELIA, STUDY42 [Europe + Australia]), and 24 (85.7%) international studies across the US and 46 other countries. Considering the distribution of race (White: 86.3%, Black: 8.4%, Asian: 4.9%) of Gyn cancers in the US, Black patients had lower enrollment (45% of expected enrollment) vs. White patients (95% of expected enrollment, P&lt;0.0001). African countries were rarely included among the recruitment sites. Two international trials reported patient recruitment from South Africa (3.2% Black, 6\/188 patients, 38% of expected enrollment).However, Asian patients had higher enrollment (269% of expected enrollment, P&lt;0.0001) compared to White patients. In 13 trials that included study sites in East Asia, Asian patients comprised 16% of the trial population (1310\/8205 patients; 327% of expected enrollment) vs. 3.2% in trials that did not open in Asia (n=15) (181\/5558 patients; 67% of expected enrollment).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            Black patients were underrepresented in pivotal trials that led to FDA approvals for Gyn cancers. Overrepresentation of Asian patients was likely due to international enrollment from East Asia.

Participants were classified as non-adherent to cervical cancer guidelines if their last Pap smear test was more than three years ago. Survey-weighted Poisson regression models [adjusted for age, race, and education] were used to explore adherence ratios before and following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            In 2019, among 1,944 female adults, representing a population of 93,477,003 adults, the mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 44.5(12.6) years, 61.1% were non-Hispanic White, and 35.2% had a college education or higher. The prevalence of non-adherence to cervical cancer screening was 19.2% [95% CI: 16.3, 22.5]. In adjusted models, being non-Hispanic Black was associated with a lower risk of non-adherence (0.49 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.77] vs. non-Hispanic White), having lower education (less than high school vs. college graduate or higher) was associated with 2.28 [95% CI: 1.21, 4.31] higher likelihood of non-adherence to cervical cancer screening guidelines, while age was not (p&gt;0.05). In 2022, the prevalence of non-adherence to cervical cancer screening was 25.8% [95% CI: 22.9, 29.1]. In adjusted models, having lower education was associated with 1.90 [95% CI: 1.22, 2.97] higher likelihood of non-adherence to cervical cancer screening guidelines, while age and race were not (p&gt;0.05). Compared to 2019, non-adherence rates increased by 6.6% in 2022. When stratified by race, non-Hispanic White adults showed an increase of 5.6% [95% CI: 5.4, 5.6] in non-adherence rates, while non-Hispanic Black adults showed an increase of 13.9% [95% CI: 12.0, 15.2].\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            There was a decline in adherence to cervical cancer screening guidelines among adult females in the US by about 7% following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, our mitochondrial (16S) and nuclear DNA (CMYC) haplotype networks suggest that H. o. ocellatus and H. endjami are not hybridising on Bioko. Finally, we report colour pattern variation in H. endjami and H. o. ocellatus that is unique from populations on the continent, and describe male advertisement calls of Bioko H. endjami and H. o. ocellatus. Our study provides a first look at the diversity and distribution of reed frogs on Bioko Island and sets the stage for future studies of the ecology, evolution, and conservation of this island community.

Because the images must be interpreted by a medical expert, it is infeasible to screen all individuals with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy. Deep learning has shown impressive results for automatic analysis and grading of fundus images. One drawback is, however, the lack of interpretability, which hampers the implementation of such systems in the clinic. Explainable artificial intelligence methods can be applied to explain the deep neural networks. Explanations based on concepts have shown to be intuitive for humans to understand, but have not yet been explored in detail for diabetic retinopathy grading. This work investigates and compares two concept-based explanation techniques for explaining deep neural networks developed for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors and Concept Bottleneck Models. We found that both methods have strengths and weaknesses, and choice of method should take the available data and the end user\u2019s preferences into account.

The survey assessed access to and attitudes, beliefs and experience with telehealth as part of routine care and clinical trials. Demographics including age, gender, race\/ethnicity, marital status, income, insurance type and education were self-reported.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            The survey was administered to 100 patients with cancer (breast cancer, n=25; gastrointestinal cancer, n=25; genitourinary cancer n=25; and hematologic malignancy, n=25); 37% were actively enrolled or previously enrolled on a clinical trial. The mean age was 61 years; 51% were female; 45% non-White, and 23% Hispanic. The majority (63%) reported traveling &gt;30 min to their treatment, with 48% reporting travel costs &gt;$20 per visit. Six percent reported difficulty receiving treatment due to cost, and 23% reported difficulty getting to visits due to other conditions or disabilities. The majority (87%) reported having access to a computer or electronic device; 99% of those had internet access and 81% were comfortable using the internet. Of those who had prior video visits (59%), almost all (97%) reported that video visits addressed their issues\/questions well. About a quarter of the patients who had not had a video visit reported that they would prefer to have video visits about a cancer-related issue rather than going into the office. For those who preferred a video visit (n=18), top reasons included elimination of travel, convenience, and not feeling rushed. Top barriers among those who expressed hesitance (n=23) included lack of access to necessary technology, not knowing how to use the technology, concern about getting the same level of care, or preference for in-person communication. Similar to video visits, 52% participants reported that they had a scheduled telephone visit with their oncologist instead of going to the office; 98% reported that their issues were either somewhat or very well addressed.\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            In this cross-sectional study amongst a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population, we found that most patients with cancer on active treatment had access to telehealth and were satisfied with telehealth visits.

Management of these results varies by institution. From 2021-2024, we completed an iterative approach to determine the most effective method for follow-up germline testing.\n            <jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>\n            We conducted 3 six-month sequential phases to determine the most effective approach to follow up on somatic findings concerning for germline origin. Phase I (3-9\/2021), consisted of weekly e-mail notifications sent by the genetics program to the referring provider regarding patients who had somatic mutations of potential germline origin, and recommended providers refer the patient to genetics. Phase 2 (10\/2021-4\/2022), consisted of monthly e-mail notifications to the referring provider, clinical staff and included cancer center leadership. In phase 3 (10\/2023-4\/2024), GC assistants and medical secretaries facilitated referrals and direct outreach to schedule patients for germline follow-up. We measured the percentage of patients referred to genetics, who completed germline testing, and had confirmed pathogenic germline mutations.\n            <jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold>\n            In Phase I, 38% of patients were referred to genetics, 23.5% completed germline testing, and 37% had positive results (Table 1). In Phase 2, 19% of patients were referred to genetics, 4.7% completed germline testing, and 43% had positive results. In Phase 3, using the GC facilitated approach, 87.5% (70\/80) of patients were referred. Those not referred had already undergone germline testing, were deceased or transferred care out of state. Of the 70 patients, 38 met with a GC and 30 elected to proceed with germline testing. There are 25 (36%) genetic test results available to date. 37% (26\/70) patients did not complete a genetics appointment. 58% (15\/26) could not be reached to schedule an appointment. Nine individuals declined or deferred an appointment. Five patients were deceased before a genetics appointment could be coordinated. For those that received referrals to genetics in phase 3, the germline positive results rate was 92% (23\/25).\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold>\n            The GC driven referral pathway was most effective at facilitating referral and completion of confirmatory testing for patients with somatic findings concerning for germline origin. Follow-up of these results shows an extremely high rate of germline positive results, making subsequent testing imperative for centers treating cancer patients. Given implications for cascade testing, future research is needed to study upfront consenting approaches to automate subsequent germline testing and notification in this population.\n            <jats:table-wrap orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"anchor\">\n              <jats:table content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                <jats:thead content-type=\"mtgabstract\">\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom align-left\" rowspan=\"1\">Phase<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">Intervention<\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      Potential Germline\n                      <jats:italic>n,<\/jats:italic>\n                      (%)\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      Referred\n                      <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\n                      , (%)\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      Completed\n                      <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\n                      , (%)\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                    <jats:th colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"border-bottom\" rowspan=\"1\">\n                      Germline Positive\n                      <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\n                      , (%)\n                    <\/jats:th>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:thead>\n                <jats:tbody>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">1<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Weekly Emails<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">162<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">62 (38%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">38 (61%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">14 (37%)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">2<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Monthly Emails<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">150<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">28 (19%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">7 (25%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">3 (43%)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                  <jats:tr>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" content-type=\"row-heading\" rowspan=\"1\">3<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">GC Driven Referrals<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">80<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">70 (87.5%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">25 (36%)<\/jats:td>\n                    <jats:td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">23 (92%)<\/jats:td>\n                  <\/jats:tr>\n                <\/jats:tbody>\n              <\/jats:table>\n            <\/jats:table-wrap>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["JCO Oncology Practice"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fsurg.2024.1273843","title":["Anterolateral thigh free flap using modified turbocharging method: a case report"],"author":[{"given":"Yooseok","family":"Ha","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Donghyun","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hyeokjae","family":"Kwon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sunje","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Seung Han","family":"Song","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sang-Ha","family":"Oh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Joo-hak","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ho Jik","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hyunwoo","family":"Kyung","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The free flap is a versatile option for reconstruction of soft tissue defects around the ankle.

All clouds influence the Earth's radiative budget, with their net radiative forcing being negative. However, high-level clouds warrant special attention due to their atmospheric warming effects. A comprehensive characterization of cirrus requires information on cloud coverage, obtainable from various data types. Active satellite sensors are presently the most accurate source for cirrus data, but their usefulness in climatological studies is limited. On the contrary, passive data, available for the past 40 years with sufficient temporal resolution for climatological research, were not specifically designed for cirrus detection. In this study, we assessed the utility of MODIS standard products for creating a cirrus mask by validating them against CALIOP data. Our objective was to determine if a MODIS product exists that detects cirrus with the same accuracy as CALIOP. Using CALIOP data as the reference, we evaluated six tests for cirrus detection considered in MODIS cloud masking algorithm and their combination (ALL TESTS CONSOLIDATION, ATC). Additionally we applied two ISCCP-originating tests: ISCCP3.6 and ISCCP23 tests. All tests have been applied to MODIS radiances. Study revealed that ATC test was the most effective resulting with the overall accuracy of 72.98 % during daytime and 59.50 % at night (probability of detection: 80.87 % and 25.46 %, false alarm rate of 34.86 % and 6.90 %, and Cohen's kapppa coefficient of 0.46 and 0.19 respectively). However, its effectiveness was notably reduced during nighttime compared to daytime.

Conventionally, the concentration-discharge relationship (C-Q) and statistical approaches to describe it, such as the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge and Seasons (WRTDS), have been widely used. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches, especially Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models, have shown predictive capability for discharge, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. However, it is not clear if such advances can be expanded to water quality variables driven by complex subsurface biogeochemical processes. This work evaluates the performance of LSTM and WRTDS for 20 water quality variables across ~500 catchments in the continental US. We find that LSTM does not markedly outperform WRTDS in our dataset, potentially limited by the current measurement capabilities of water quality across CONUS. Both models present similar performance patterns across water quality variables, with the LSTM displaying better performance for nutrients compared to weathering-derived solutes. Additionally, the LSTM does not benefit from flexibility in the inputs. For example, incorporation of climate data that constrains streamflow generation, does not significantly improve the LSTM performance. We also find that data availability is not a straightforward predictor of LSTM model performance, although higher availability tends to stabilize performance. To fully assess the potential of the LSTM model, it may be necessary to use a higher frequency dataset across the CONUS, which does not exist today. To evaluate the dynamics of C-Q patterns relative to model performance, we introduce a \u201csimplicity index\u201d considering both the seasonality in the concentration pattern and the linearity in the C-Q relationship, or the C-Q-t pattern. The simplicity index is strongly correlated with model performance and differentiates the underlying controls on water quality dynamics. Further DL experiments and model-intercomparison highlight the strengths and deficiencies of existing frameworks, pointing to the need for further hydrogeochemical theories that are amenable to complex basins and solutes.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Frontiers in Water"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.3389\/fonc.2024.1460150","title":["Inhibition of ATM or ATR in combination with hypo-fractionated radiotherapy leads to a different immunophenotype on transcript and protein level in HNSCC"],"author":[{"given":"Julia","family":"Meidenbauer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Matthias","family":"Wachter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sebastian R.","family":"Schulz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nada","family":"Mostafa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lilli","family":"Z\u00fclch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Benjamin","family":"Frey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rainer","family":"Fietkau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Udo S.","family":"Gaipl","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tina","family":"Jost","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>Background<\/jats:title><jats:p>The treatment of head and neck tumors remains a challenge due to their reduced radiosensitivity.

Aim   This study aimed to establish a list of priority animals of concern to \u014aa\u1e3bapa\u1e3bmi (senior knowledge holders) in the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area, north-eastern Arnhem Land, Australia. This list could focus the research and management efforts of the Yirralka Rangers and collaborators.     Methods   Adhering to local governance structures, through six group-elicitation sessions, \u014aa\u1e3bapa\u1e3bmi were asked to identify animals of concern and describe reasons for concern. Existing occurrence records and threat status of these species were compiled to assess baseline data and guide next steps.     Results   The \u014aa\u1e3bapa\u1e3bmi-defined Laynhapuy Priority Animal List contained 30 animals (species\/groups), with the highest-ranked animals including Marrtjinyami w\u00e4yin (walking animals), Rupu (possums), and Djanda (goannas), all mammals and varanid lizards. The list of 30 animals included 43 species from a Western-science perspective, of which 12 were also listed as threatened through Western conservation frameworks. Some animals were considered high priority locally, such as the wa\u1e49\u2019kurra (northern brown bandicoot, Isoodon macrourus), although not a concern from a Western-science perspective, demonstrating mismatch between local and larger-scale approaches. To help disentangle whether this mismatch is due to cultural significance and\/or localised decline not captured at larger-scale assessments, we provide the animal\u2019s publicly known Yol\u014bu clan connections and reasons for concern alongside existing baseline occurrence data. Recent collaborative surveys have substantially increased data for Laynhapuy Priority Animals, demonstrating the benefits of community engaged wildlife research.     Conclusions   Multidisciplinary research collaborations can produce Indigenous-led \u2018working\u2019 lists of priority animals to guide culturally attuned on-ground action. Approaches that draw on different cultural knowledge systems require interrogation of how knowledge is created and conveyed to ensure mutual comprehension and practical use.

Recent studies have focused on the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) as a therapeutic tphytochemicalsits ron the prolifa eration of cancer cells. Phytoco tituents from Curcuma longa ar known for their anti-cancer propertisignallingg them potential candidates for ovarian cancer treatment. This computational study aims to evaluate the molecular docking and pharmacokinetic profiles of ,phytochemicals in Curcuma longa against IGF-1R to explore their potential to inhicer ,progression.\n<bold>Results: <\/bold>Molecular docking analysis showed that digalloyl-hexoside had the highest binding affinity with IGF-1R, with a docking score of -8.849 kcal\/mol. Hyperoside and valoneic acid dilactone followed closely, showing strong interactions as well. All three compounds exhibited six hydrogen bonds with key residues like ASP 1056 and LYS 1003, contributing to their strong binding potential. Caffeic acid showed the lowest affinity with a docking score of -7.985 kcal\/mol. ADMET analysis reveal ed that caffeic acid had the highest gastrointestinal absorption and skin permeability, adhering to Lipinski\u2019s rule of five. In contrast, digalloyl-hexoside, hyperoside, and valoneic acid dilactone had lower bioavailability and gastrointestinal absorption but exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetic properties.\n<bold>Conclusion<\/bold>: Digalloyl-hexoside exhibited the highest binding affinity, followed by hyperoside and valoneic acid dilactone, though all compounds had lower docking scores than the reference ligand. ADMET analysis revealed that while caffeic acid had the highest absorption, the other compounds showed better overall pharmacokinetic profiles. However, low gastrointestinal absorption limits their bioavailability. Further research, including structural modifications and additional validation, is recommended.<\/p>"},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1007\/s00259-024-06902-8","title":["Long-term trends in total administered radiation dose from brain [18F]FDG-PET in children with drug-resistant epilepsy"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2224-0083","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Antonio G.","family":"Gennari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4175-0476","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Stephan","family":"Waelti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9095-032X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Moritz","family":"Schwyzer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4584-3031","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Valerie","family":"Treyer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6845-1199","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexia","family":"Rossi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4812-987X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thomas","family":"Sartoretti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6964-802X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alexander","family":"Maurer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7931-2327","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Georgia","family":"Ramantani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5932-7786","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ruth","family":"Tuura O\u2019Gorman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9122-2431","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christian J.","family":"Kellenberger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4849-3292","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Martin W.","family":"H\u00fcllner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7815-3048","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michael","family":"Messerli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:sec>\n              <jats:title>Purpose<\/jats:title>\n              <jats:p>To assess the trends in administered 2-[<jats:sup>18<\/jats:sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([<jats:sup>18<\/jats:sup>F]FDG) doses, computed tomography (CT) radiation doses, and image quality over the last 15\u00a0years in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) undergoing hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n              <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n              <jats:p>We retrospectively analyzed data from children with DRE who had [<jats:sup>18<\/jats:sup>F]FDG-PET\/CT or magnetic resonance scans for presurgical evaluation between 2005 and 2021.

A multi-use thermoelectric refrigerator powered by solar energy to obtain the lowest consumption with the highest efficiency. The designed refrigerator is based on the Peltier effect using Peltier units where a temperature difference is created between the junctions by applying a voltage difference across the junction. This study investigates the performance of a refrigerator cooling system powered by a photovoltaic (PV) system. The research aims to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and feasibility of utilizing solar energy to drive refrigeration, particularly in off-grid or environmentally conscious applications. Through a comprehensive experimental setup and data analysis, the study examines energy consumption, cooling efficiency, and overall system performance under varying conditions. The findings contribute valuable insights into the potential of PV-powered refrigerators as sustainable cooling solutions. It relies on a control unit that measures the resulting temperature to determine the appropriate connection mode to give the highest cooling efficiency.

The Fast not Eco mode is the least energy consuming and the fastest cooling, it can be used for rapid cooling at a short time less than an hour. The best mode in the case of continuous operation is the case of as next Eco mode cooling temperature of 20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00a0\u00b0C. The MATLAB Simulink model was developed to reduce the design cycle and facilitate the integration of solar photovoltaic with the TEC.

Specifically, MET up-regulated VEGFR2 expression in a MAPK\/ERK\/ETS1-dependent manner, while VEGF promoted physical interaction between VEGFR2 and MET, thereby facilitating MET phosphorylation. A MET inhibitor, crizotinib, combined with an anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, enhanced the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib and synergistically inhibited the activation of downstream signaling in vitro.

Traditional protection methods fail to discriminate fault and other dynamic volatilities in the system. The paper presents a novel two-level adaptive relay algorithm to avoid nuisance tripping in a grid-connected microgrid under varying grid dynamics. The novelty of the adaptive relay algorithm is that nuisance tripping is eliminated by precisely determining normal system-level dynamics at the first level using a phase deviation reference block. The first level determines the necessity for activating the second level, which consists of a detection scheme combining a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The hybrid DWT-SVM methodology ensures effective fault diagnosis, adapting to variations in energy sources, load fluctuations, and fault scenarios. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation validates the system\u2019s effectiveness in dynamic microgrid environments. Extensive experiments on scenarios, including faults, fluctuations in renewable energy generation, and intermittent simulations of EV charging and capacitor switching, were conducted to test the efficacy of the adaptive relay algorithm.

The degree of hydrophobicity of the test soils was assessed through the measurement of apparent water contact angle. In each internal erosion test, the cumulative particle loss, deformation and hydraulic conductivity were evaluated. The water-repellent coatings efficiently suppressed the progression of internal erosion at practical hydraulic gradients because of their smaller fluid\u2013solid adhesion.

The first goal is the optimization of transportation distances made by tower cranes, which will address the issues of efficiency and cost. This is done in a way that provides for minimization of the distances that lie between the trailer parking where elements are parked, the tower crane, and the construction installation point. However, current research fails to address the dynamic movement efficiency of trailers, especially when handling multiple trailers and several models of tower cranes, making this scenario an optimization problem that is classified as NP-hard due to the likelihood of causing a combinatorial explosion. This work endeavors to present a new mathematical model that has been applied to the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The ideal demand-generated model is designed to solve the optimal model and position of tower cranes and the prospective positioning of trailers for parking. The feasibility and applicability of the method exploited in the study are also established through a project case study.

However, the challenge of this technique is the difficulty of tuning the weighting factor so that it performs optimally at all speeds. Hence, this paper proposes a new method for improving the optimization technique by automatically tuning the weighting factor using a flux controller. The flux controller is represented as a DC gain and designed to be proportional to the absolute value of the predicted stator flux error. This method eliminates the need for complex computation to select the suitable weighting factor while also efficiently regulating flux and torque. The proposed method is experimentally validated on a DS1104 controller board and compared to a constant flux weighting factor method that was tested under speed conditions. The results demonstrate that the new method can further decrease the torque ripple compared to the constant weighting factor while maintaining the flux ripple and harmonic distortion limits.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.29333\/aje.2024.9213a","title":["Effectiveness of Editing and Proofreading Skills in Improving Academic Writing of Law Students"],"author":[{"name":"Institute of Accountancy Arusha, Tanzania, simon.mlundi@iaa.ac.tz & symonmlundi2017@gmail.com","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Simon","family":"Mlundi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Writing skills are the most difficult language skills for students, especially those students with English as a Second Language (ESL) and as an English Foreign Language (EFL) in various academic institutions.

Has EU economic governance constrained health spending? If so, have these spending levels led to inequalities, which in turn shaped responses to the pandemic? EU economic governance is often dismissed as ineffective because of its poor track record of compliance. Yet austerity is blamed for negative health outcomes. This article shows that the EU fiscal rule is a determinant of health because it affects fiscal policies of European countries. First, the analysis of EU member states during 1995\u20132018 shows that austerity policies affect health spending and health inequalities. Euro-area countries under the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure significantly consolidated their health spending.

It is the first line of protection against\ninvading pathogens and the starting point for the immune system. The focus of this review is on\nthe use of amphibian-derived peptides and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the treatment of\nwound healing. When skin is injured, a chain reaction begins that includes inflammation, the formation\nof new tissue, and remodelling of existing tissue to aid in the healing process. Collaborating\nwith non-immune cells, resident and recruited immune cells in the skin remove foreign invaders\nand debris, then direct the repair and regeneration of injured host tissues. Restoration of\nnormal structure and function requires the healing of damaged tissues. However, a major issue\nthat slows wound healing is infection. AMPs are just one type of host-defense chemicals that have\ndeveloped in multicellular animals to regulate the immune response and limit microbial proliferation\nin response to various types of biological or physical stress. Therefore, peptides isolated from\namphibians represent novel therapeutic tools and approaches for regenerating damaged skin. Peptides\nthat speed up the healing process could be used as therapeutic lead molecules in future research\ninto novel drugs. AMPs and amphibian-derived peptides may be endogenous mediators of\nwound healing and treat non-life-threatening skin and epithelial lesions.

Setiap hari, timbulan sampah meningkat seiring pertumbuhan populasi, mengurangi ruang dan menurunkan kualitas hidup manusia. Sampah, baik cair, padat, maupun gas, seringkali tidak dikelola dengan baik, menyebabkan pencemaran lingkungan. Kurangnya kesadaran dan partisipasi masyarakat dalam pengelolaan sampah, serta kurangnya pengetahuan dalam memilah sampah, memperparah situasi ini. Penelitian ini menyoroti Bank Sampah Pematang Pudu Bersih di Kecamatan Mandau, Kabupaten Bengkalis, Provinsi Riau, sebagai model pengelolaan sampah berbasis masyarakat yang efektif. Bank sampah ini tidak hanya mengelola sampah tetapi juga menjadi pusat pemberdayaan ekonomi. Masyarakat dapat menukar sampah anorganik dengan uang atau barang, memberikan insentif finansial yang mendorong partisipasi aktif mereka. Selain mengurangi volume sampah di tempat pembuangan akhir (TPA), bank sampah ini menciptakan lapangan kerja baru dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat, khususnya mereka yang berada di bawah garis kemiskinan. Penelitian menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan deskriptif, mengandalkan wawancara mendalam, dokumentasi, dan studi pustaka untuk mengungkap makna dari informasi yang diberikan oleh informan melalui teknik purposive sampling. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa keberhasilan Bank Sampah Pematang Pudu Bersih sangat bergantung pada pola kerja sama Pentahelix yang melibatkan antara pemerintah, perusahaan, LSM, dan masyarakat, serta dukungan teknologi inovatif. Dengan mengintegrasikan aspek ekonomi, sosial, dan lingkungan, bank sampah menjadi solusi yang tidak hanya mengurangi permasalahan sampah tetapi juga memperbaiki kualitas hidup masyarakat dan menjaga kelestarian lingkungan.

In total, 18 of 47 mobile apps that meet the final criteria were reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). We found that more than half of the apps had below-average quality and most offered only a few distinct functionalities. Six of them were deemed high quality since they met all standard criteria. In terms of self-management features, we identified several important features such as the provision of a seizure calendar (14\/18, 78%), report generation (5\/18, 28%), adding individual seizure occurrence and causes (9\/18, 50%), and emergency alert (6\/18, 34%). The majority of the apps included medication tracker (12\/18, 67%), expert consultation (6\/18, 34%), and educational features (10\/18, 56%). Moreover, 40% of included apps have considered self-efficacy features by providing analytical support for seizure frequency, duration, occurrence distribution, and analysis.

Traditional feature selection methods frequently struggle to guarantee improved classification performance by including more features. Instead, they often rely on utilising the entire feature set. To address these challenges, a robust feature selection algorithm known as ranked mutual information for support vector machines (rMI-SVM) has been introduced. This approach mitigates the risk of overfitting by selecting features that augment the classification model with additional information, thereby ensuring enhanced performance as more features are selected. rMI-SVM can accommodate datasets with missing values regardless of data linearity as it does not require additional parameters or preset the number of features needed. The proposed method offers a solution to the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, and explicitly identifies the optimal number of features required for a classification model, thus circumventing the necessity of using the full feature set. These findings are supported by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which highlight the effectiveness of rMI-SVM in outperforming existing baselines and delivering a superior classification model performance.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.11591\/eei.v13i5.8004","title":["Comparative analysis of machine learning approaches in Kazakh banknote classification"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2674-1611","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ualikhan","family":"Sadyk","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Makhambet","family":"Yerzhan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9405-2041","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rashid","family":"Baimukashev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2879-2447","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cemil","family":"Turan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Nowadays, smartphones seamlessly blend into every aspect of our lives, including as handheld assistants for individuals with disabilities.

The results reveal that the regional competitiveness in Luwu Raya is unevenly distributed. Palopo City is the region with the highest level of competitiveness, while two regencies, North Luwu and Luwu, have the lowest levels of competitiveness. The most influential aspect of regional competitiveness is infrastructure, as measured by data on the condition of paved roads and clean water distribution. The problem that needs to be addressed in almost all regions of Luwu Raya is poverty.

This emerging rule \u2013 called Pillar Two in international tax circles \u2013 is inadequate for dealing with poverty and inequality in an asymmetrical global context. The rule is premised on the notion and argument that tax competition is a problem for international tax law. Notwithstanding, there is existing research and evidence to show that tax competition can also be a solution to the enormous challenge of poverty and inequality as it can have a redistributive effect. This is a valuable factor amid the inefficiently asymmetrical global society with extreme poverty in many countries and enormous wealth in a few others.This article submits that the Pillar Two minimum tax rule \u2013 the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules encompassing the income inclusion rule (IIR), undertaxed payment\/profit rule (UTPR), and qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) \u2013 should incorporate inter-nation equity to prevent exacerbating global inequality and poverty. Pillar Two intensifies these for at least two reasons: (1) it restricts the positive redistributive effects of tax competition on an inefficiently asymmetrical global society, and (2) it encourages tax competition more suited for high-income countries (HICs) and less suited for those that are low-income countries (LICs). There is latitude to incorporate a differentiated principle deriving from inter-nation equity into this new Pillar Two rule designed to regulate tax competition globally. This proposal requires that the emerging rule be disenabled in certain circumstances to enable LICs to choose whether to apply the rule without being worse off. The article\u2019s proposal seeks to allow LICs room for effective tax competition needed to attain sustainable development goals.<\/jats:italic>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Intertax"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1152\/physrev.00040.2023","title":["Understanding coenzyme Q"],"author":[{"given":"Ying","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}]},{"given":"Noah","family":"Lilienfeldt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3592-5711","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Siegfried","family":"Hekimi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Coenzyme Q (CoQ), also known as ubiquinone, comprises a benzoquinone head group and a long isoprenoid side chain.

In fact, CoQ appears to be central to the entire redox balance of the cell. Remarkably, its structure and therefore its properties have not changed from bacteria to vertebrates. In metazoans, it is synthesized in all cells and is found in most, and maybe all, biological membranes.

We also review CoQ biosynthesis, which is particularly complex because of its extreme hydrophobicity, as well as the biological consequences of primary and secondary CoQ deficiency, including in human patients. Primary CoQ deficiency is a rare inborn condition due to mutation in CoQ biosynthetic genes. Secondary CoQ deficiency is much more common, as it accompanies a variety of pathological conditions, including mitochondrial disorders as well as aging.

This assumption is often impractical given common privacy practices surrounding location data. To measure the risk of an MIA performed by a realistic adversary, we develop the first Zero Auxiliary Knowledge (ZK) MIA on aggregate location data, which eliminates the need for an auxiliary dataset of real individual traces.

Using two large-scale location datasets, we demonstrate that our ZK MIA matches the state-of-the-art Knock-Knock (KK) MIA across a wide range of settings, including popular implementations of differential privacy (DP) and suppression of small counts. Furthermore, we show that ZK MIA remains highly effective even when the adversary only knows a small fraction (10%) of their target's location history.

As ACT protocols necessarily leak some information by design, defining privacy is difficult. For example, a user cannot deny having met another user. Ideally, however, the user can plausibly deny everything else, in particular, when they met.

This holds even if malicious users treat smartphones as black-boxes.\n Unidirectional protocols are usually very efficient and many proposals are unidirectional, e.g., the widely-deployed Google-Apple Exposure Notifications.

While most previous MIAs have focused on inferring the membership of individual nodes and edges within the training graph, we introduce a novel form of membership inference attack called the Structure Membership Inference Attack (SMIA) which aims to determine whether a given set of nodes corresponds to a particular target structure, such as a clique or a multi-hop path, within the original training graph. To address this issue, we present novel black-box SMIA attacks that leverage the prediction outputs generated by the target GNN model for inference. Our approach involves training a three-label classifier, which, in combination with shadow training, aids in enabling the inference attack. Our extensive experimental evaluation of three representative GNN models and three real-world graph datasets demonstrates that our proposed attacks consistently outperform three baseline methods, including the one that employs the conventional link membership inference attacks to infer the subgraph structure. Additionally, we design a defense mechanism that introduces perturbations to the node embeddings thus influencing the corresponding prediction outputs by the target model. Our defense selectively perturbs dimensions within the node embeddings that have the least impact on the model's accuracy.

For this purpose, daily precipitation data were disaggregated for various durations between 5 min and 24 hours and the best fit distribution was chosen among the Gumbel, Weibull, Pearson, Log-Pearson and Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) distributions for the time series of these durations. From the fitted distribution, rainfall for various durations and frequencies were obtained to generate the IDF curves for each location. No single satisfactory distribution was identified for all cases, with Pearson III and Log-Pearson III being the most common. For the IDF curves, the four-parameter equation was fitted and the parameter values were determined by non-linear regression. These varied a lot within the Para\u00edba state and were regionalized to obtain the IDF equation for any location in the state. The rainfall intensities obtained from the parameters determined in this study, when compared with those derived from the previously existing equations, show large differences and need updating.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Revista Brasileira de Engenharia Agr\u00edcola e Ambiental"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.30935\/ojcmt\/14957","title":["Exploration of the online learners\u2019 actions: A sequence mining approach"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-4728-2462","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rusada","family":"Natthaphatwirata","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Education, Prince of Songkla University Pattani Campus, Pattani, THAILAND"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1120-3324","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Wannisa","family":"Matcha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Communication Sciences, Prince of Songkla University Pattani Campus, Pattani, THAILAND"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper presents the exploration of the learners\u2019 learning engagement in a self-paced massive open online course (MOOC). Research often claims that engagement contributes to learning success. However, there is still limited understanding of engagement and its characteristics. This research aims to fulfil this gap by exploring how different patterns detected based on the density levels of engagement contribute to learning performance. A total number of 159,804 records of trace data from 971 learners who enrolled in a self-paced MOOC were used in this study. The sequence mining technique was used to formulate the sequence of learning engagement. Hierarchical clustering was then used to automate the pattern recognition of the formulated sequences. As a result, four groups of learners were detected based on a similar pattern of engagement levels. Sequence mining was then used to examine the learning engagement pattern. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the statistically significant differences in terms of final scores among the detected groups. The results revealed two successful groups of learners with different patterns of engagement and two unsuccessful groups. Successful learners are intensively engaged in learning activities in the short and long run, whereas unsuccessful groups tend to be less engaged. This paper extends the previous exploration of the engagement. That is, the level identified based on the density of interactive engagement as recorded in the system can be used to determine the learning patterns, consequently, reflective of individual\u2019s learning profiles.

First, the inquiry will critically engage previous studies that have touched on ecotheology in South Africa (SA) to substantiate my arguments on the failure to address practical issues (hence, practical theology) affecting local communities and the environment. In other words, the study seeks to answer the following questions: (1) what is the contribution of the church in both the collection \nand disposition of garbage in our cities? (2) what is the relevance of Practical Theology as a field of study in addressing the increase of street loitering and deterioration of sanitary conditions in our major cities? (3) Is it not possible for a church or group of churches to adopt either a community or a street in an effort to maintain it? Second, the present study seeks to decolonize the myth of erecting massive mega churches as if to suggest that God abides in a building. It is argued that the extravagant expenditure by the church could be put to better use by way of awareness campaigns against poverty, poaching, and veldt fires.

Early Reformers formulated this doctrine on the basis of \nSacred Scripture (Sola Scriptura) affirming salvation as the grace of God (Sola Gratia) through faith alone (Sola Fide), in the divine sending work of Christ (Solus Christus) and consequently giving all Glory to God alone (Soli Deo Gloria).

While these five solas are correctly expressed within the theological framework of the teachings of Calvinism, abbreviated TULIP, they are considered here from the broad perspective of their emergence in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. Consequently, this contribution uses the broad perspective of both the Solae doctrines in conjunction with presbyterii fidelium with expressed intention of deepening the understanding of human participation in the context of the Missio Dei.

Without a doubt, gender inequality is a pervasive issue that exists in most of the world\u2019s religions. The subjugation of women to men is an unfortunate reality that cannot be ignored or overlooked. It is a critical issue that needs to be addressed and resolved to bring about equality and justice for all. This research focused specifically on the marital inequalities that African Initiated Churches in Zimbabwe present through their perceptions, interpretations, and beliefs of the doctrine of wife submission. The insights of social conflict theory are utilized to interrogate the marital inequalities that are found in the African Initiated Churches in Zimbabwe. This discussion is based on the research that was carried out through interviews, with semi-structured questions, of a sample of twenty members (ten males and ten females) of eleven different African Initiated Churches in Zimbabwe. The main findings of this research are that the doctrine of wife submission is being interpreted in a way that contradicts marital equality by African Initiated Churches in Zimbabwe. This interpretation renders wives subordinate to their husbands, which creates a social conflict when their needs are not adequately represented by their husbands. This article ultimately recommends that the \ndoctrine of wife submission be reinterpreted to fit into the contemporary marital equality \ndiscourse through Bible annotations that are marital equality compliant on the Biblical\npassages that are perpetuating a wife\u2019s submission.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Pharos Journal of Theology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1152\/physrev.00039.2023","title":["Lung antimicrobial proteins and peptides: from host defense to therapeutic strategies"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2028-2087","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yuanpu Peter","family":"Di","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9771-3784","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jenna Marie","family":"Kuhn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5991-5868","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maria Luisa","family":"Mangoni","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biochemical Sciences, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Representing severe morbidity and mortality globally, respiratory infections associated with chronic respiratory diseases, including complicated pneumonia, asthma, interstitial lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are a major public health concern.

The disruptive consequences forced the government to provide a rapid, large-scale response while choosing between preserving the past or ambitiously embracing the future, thus following the main discourses among urban planners of that time. Beyond this emergency phase, however, more in-depth questioning about national identity and people\u2019s sense of place arose, which translated into embraced or rejected architectural styles and urban planning proposals. The interplay between remembering and forgetting exhibited divergent urban planning proposals, which made the decision on how to rebuild the city difficult, delaying the reconstruction process. Since opinions on what to remember rely on people\u2019s personal sense of remembrance, the spatial translation of how to remember requires a multi-layered approach where spaces for memory, such as memorials, cemeteries and monuments, and memories of places that relate to experiences in the everyday life of the residents, intertwine.

This infers significant improvement in gas turbine engine operational economics and performance. However, implementation of tandem configuration invites additional three dimensionalities in the flow field. This complicates the design process limiting the realization of the tandem bladed rotor concept. The present study addresses the strategies for development of a low-speed axial compressor design implementing tandem bladed rotor and single stator. Both the rotor and stator flow mechanisms have been investigated in detail using steady state simulations. A highly loaded tandem bladed rotor is followed by single bladed stator which handles the highly swirled flow. The single blade configuration of stator results in higher diffusion factor which is more susceptible to the flow separation. Moreover, a dual wake structure evolves through the rotor passage due to highly loaded individual blades. The stage design follows an unconventional approach of tandem rotor-single stator over the reported tandem rotor-tandem stator or only tandem bladed stator configuration. The aerodynamic match between the tandem bladed rotor and stator has been of critical importance in development of this design. The rotor has been designed for highest possible energization of flow by fine tuning the variation of tandem nozzle geometry throughout the span to complement the intended loading profile.   The stator is aimed at letting the flow pass through with a chordwise varying diffusion profile. The novelty of the work lies in discussion of tandem rotor and single bladed stator flow physics altogether highlighting the interdependence of decision-making process for both.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Applied Fluid Mechanics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.47176\/jafm.17.10.2548","title":["Simulation of Very Low Frequency Pulsed Fluidized Bed"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Achieving high fluidization quality and bed stability is a paramount challenge in pulsed fluidized beds. 2D hydrodynamics models were studied using the Eulerian-Eulerian method with KTGF.

Achieving efficient fuel mixing and complete combustion within a short period poses a substantial challenge. This study has directed efforts towards improving mixing and minimizing total pressure losses across the supersonic combustor to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of fuel injection geometry in the supersonic combustor with an entry Mach number of 2. Two different fuel orifice geometries, inclined at 45\u00b0, were considered. The investigation covered four different momentum flux ratios: 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 respectively. Various measurements were conducted to observe flow phenomena inside the supersonic combustion, including wall static pressure measurement, Schlieren visualization, exit Mach number and total pressure loss measurement. Without injection cases exhibited weaker compression and expansion inside the combustor. During injection, the rise in wall pressure indicated that the bow shock formed in front of the arc injection was slightly weaker than that of the circular injection. The impinging bow shock on the opposite wall also exhibited higher strength, resulting in a static pressure rise. As a result, the lower total pressure ratio across the shock indicates a higher momentum exchange between the main flow and the orifice. Therefore, arc injection has proven more effective in exchanging momentum inside the supersonic combustor. Consequently, the Mach number at the exit of the combustor was higher for the arc injection.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Applied Fluid Mechanics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.5406\/23300841.69.3.05","title":["Jan D\u0142ugosz's <i>Vita Kunegundis<\/i> as a Source for His Religiosity"],"author":[{"given":"Paul J.","family":"Radzilowski","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Madonna University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The hagiographical works of the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral Canon Jan D\u0142ugosz (1415\u20131480) have received modest attention from scholars as examples of his literary style or mentality and his treatment of topics such as the model of Church-State relations.

Teachers interpret and tailor these materials to create particular instructional strategies, therefore, teachers can be considered as lesson designers. The study presented in this paper uses longitudinal case study design to investigate the relationship between a mathematics teacher and curriculum materials over a period of nine years. Using the lens of curricular noticing, the study examined what the teacher attends to, interprets and responds to while planning a lesson. Data collection occurred at four distinct time points, encompassing both teacher observations during lesson planning and interviews after lesson planning, as well as the teacher\u2019s lesson plans for the same topic at each time point. The obtained longitudinal data provided comprehensive insights into how the teacher\u2019s curricular noticing changed over time and how it affected the teacher\u2019s practice. The findings show that the teacher attended the national curriculum and textbook at all four time points, indicating the stability of these particular resources; however, the interpretation of the textbook elements and response to this interpretation changed significantly.

A neural network control algorithm with prediction based on minimizing the quadratic quality functional is proposed. The algorithm makes it possible to minimize the root mean square error of regulation and the control signal rate of change. To determine the sequences of optimal control impacts, the application of the Newton-Raphson method is proposed. To reduce computational costs when receiving control signals, the decomposition of the original matrix, represented as a Hess matrix, is carried out. To predict the behavior of a control plant, a formula is proposed for calculating the gradient of a neural network, discrepant by the possibility of its use in the real-time mode of the control.

Compared to standard divertors (SDs), snowflake divertors (SFDs) can effectively suppress the heat flux, while the impact of magnetic configurations on W core accumulation remains unclear. In this study, the kinetic code DIVIMP combined with the SOLPS-ITER code is applied to investigate the effects of divertor magnetic configurations (SD versus SFD) on W accumulation during neon injection in HL-3. It is found that the W concentration in the core of the SFD is significantly higher than that of the SD with similar total W erosion flux. The reasons for this are: (1) W impurities in the core of the SFD mainly originate from the inner divertor, which has a short leg, and the source is close to the divertor entrance and upstream separatrix. Furthermore, the W ionization source (<jats:italic>S<\/jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>W0<\/jats:sub>) is much stronger, especially near the divertor entrance.

Moreover, the influence of W source locations at the inner target on W transport in the SFD is investigated. Tungsten impurity in the core is mainly contributed by target erosion in the common flux region (CFR) away from the strike point. This is attributed to the fact that the W source at this location enhances the ionization source above the W ion stagnation point, which sequentially increases W penetration. Therefore, the suppression of far SOL inner target erosion can effectively prevent W impurities from accumulating in the core.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Plasma Science and Technology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.11591\/eei.v13i5.7549","title":["Handover management in vehicle communication: applications, techniques, issues, and challenges: a review"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5346-6141","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Hamzah Hadi","family":"Qasim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3111-5508","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Husna","family":"Zainol Abidin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3991-7863","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Syahrul","family":"Afzal Che Abdullah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is an emerging technology that facilitates communication among vehicles and numerous environmental entities.

In southern Africa and in global literature, water is variously construed. It is perceived in diverse disciplines including water history either as a social, economic or political good. This article argues that conceptions of the commodity in post-colonial and predominantly arid to semi-arid Botswana varied historically between the social and economic value of water. However, this analysis of the social versus the economic value of water is one of the first in economic history to be undertaken outside pure and more technical economics research. Water is a scarce, perennially sought-after commodity. The search for water in Botswana stimulated conversations among community players and government on how historically endemic water scarcity had to be addressed from 1966 to 2020. In light of scarcity, the pursuit and goal of supplying water to the ever-growing population is a persistent theme in Botswana\u2019s water landscape. This transdisciplinary economic historical investigation of the societal value of water in Botswana, thus, fits into that dominant water history paradigm. The study\u2019s overarching significance is that water cannot merely be analysed in a pre-independence social goods mainstream to the detriment of its economic fundamentals in the country..<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            This article was published open access under a CC BY licence:\n            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licences\/by\/4.0\">https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licences\/by\/4.0<\/jats:ext-link>\n            .\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Global Environment"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.3828\/whpge.63837646622507","title":["Notes from the Icehouse"],"author":[{"given":"Jonatan","family":"Palmblad","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Jonatan Palmblad is Senior Editor at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, LMU Munich, and holds a Dr. des. degree in Environmental Humanities.

Before and after an on-ice training session, 33 youth ice-hockey athletes (14.9 [1.7]\u00a0y; 11 females) performed 3 repetitions of a maximal vertical countermovement jump (CMJ), an eccentric hamstring contraction, and maximal isometric hip adduction and abduction contractions.

The on-ice session reduced maximal isometric hip adduction (left: 7.3% [10.3%]; right: 9.5% [9.6%]) and abduction (left: 4.9% [6.9%]; right: 5.0% [8.1%]) force, but did not impair (<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u2009\u2265\u2009.10) CMJ performance (jump height, relative peak power, braking duration, and total duration).

This phenomenon has been proposed as a way to visualize how tidal (nonuniform) forces can cause stretching\/elongation of objects, such as the bulging of Earth's oceans under the nonuniform force of the Moon's gravity. In this manuscript, we analyze a ferrofluid in the nonuniform magnetic field of a permanent magnet and compare a simple model for the tidal stretching mechanism with the magnetic energy mechanism, which is known to stretch a ferrofluid droplet even in a uniform magnetic field. Far from the magnet, both mechanisms display power-law behavior as a function of the distance to the magnet z; for the tidal mechanism, the droplet's elongation is proportional to 1\/z8, while that due to the magnetic energy mechanism is proportional to 1\/z6. Thus, the elongation of a droplet falling toward a permanent magnet is initially dominated by the magnetic energy effect. The tidal effect overtakes the magnetic energy effect as the droplet approaches the magnet, and at a critical distance, a tidal disruption event occurs.

Research\nindicates that chitosan\/BG composites enhance angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and proliferation.\nBioglass improves biomineralization and boosts bone extracellular matrix formation\nby osteoblasts. The current findings demonstrate that the chitosan-glass nanofiber\ncomposites can enhance both antibacterial capabilities and bone conductivity. This review\nexamines novel techniques for creating chitosan-based materials for engineering purposes, as well as upcoming\ndifficulties and outlooks.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Current Organic Chemistry"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1161\/hypertensionaha.124.23406","title":["Age-Related Blood Pressure Gradients Are Associated With Blood Pressure Control and Global Population Outcomes"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6864-8514","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Janis M.","family":"Nolde","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Dobney Hypertension Centre, Medical School, Royal Perth Hospital\/Medical Research Foundation, University of Western Australia (J.M.N., R.C., M.P.S.)."},{"name":"Department of Nephrology, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Germany (J.M.N.)."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9709-7264","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Thomas","family":"Beaney","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Public Health, Imperial College London, United Kingdom (T.B., N.R.P.)."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4714-0206","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Revathy","family":"Carnagarin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dobney Hypertension Centre, Medical School, Royal Perth Hospital\/Medical Research Foundation, University of Western Australia (J.M.N., R.C., M.P.S.)."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6132-0038","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"George S.","family":"Stergiou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Hypertension Center STRIDE-7, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Third Department of Medicine, Sotiria Hospital, Greece (G.S.S.)."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6292-997X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Neil R.","family":"Poulter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Public Health, Imperial College London, United Kingdom (T.B., N.R.P.)."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9217-4937","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Aletta E.","family":"Schutte","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Population Health, University of New South Wales, Australia (A.E.S.)."},{"name":"The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, NSW, Australia (A.E.S.)."},{"name":"Hypertension in Africa Research Team, Medical Research Council Unit for Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa (A.E.S.)."}]},{"given":"Markus P.","family":"Schlaich","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dobney Hypertension Centre, Medical School, Royal Perth Hospital\/Medical Research Foundation, University of Western Australia (J.M.N., R.C., M.P.S.)."},{"name":"Departments of Cardiology and Nephrology (M.P.S.), Royal Perth Hospital, Australia."},{"name":"Neurovascular Hypertension and Kidney Disease Laboratory, Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia (M.P.S.)."}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>BACKGROUND:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The strong relationship between blood pressure (BP) and age is well known.

The key element of this project was the engagement, training, and support of Peer Educators in developing and delivering the Sexual Lives &amp; Respectful Relationships (SL&amp;RR) program and network in Gippsland. It also aimed to engage with community professionals from the sexual assault, community development and advocacy sectors to participate in violence and abuse prevention and respectful relationships education, training, and community work. SL&amp;RR is an ecological model of violence and abuse prevention that has people with an intellectual disability at the centre. It utilises a community development approach that works from the individual out to society and systems that impact the experiences of safety and well-being in relationships and communities. The model has been co-developed by people with intellectual disabilities and is co-facilitated by people with intellectual disabilities in partnership with community professionals in the sexual assault sector. The SL&amp;RR model provided the opportunity for GCASA to engage in dialogue with people with an intellectual disability, ABI, or complex communication, who are impacted significantly by sexual violence to contribute to the knowledge of people with intellectual disabilities around their rights to relationships which are free from violence. To coordinate the SL&amp;RR program and support New Wave Gippsland (NWG), a Project Coordinator and a Program Developer were appointed. To deliver the program, employment opportunities for self-advocates to deliver education and build community capacity in relation to disability awareness were provided. The program aimed to undertake the following activities: \u2022 Build the capacity of the Gippsland SL&amp;RR network to engage with people with an intellectual disability, ABI, LGBTIQA+ people with disability, community health and sexual assault professionals and services across a wider scope in Gippsland. \u2022 Deliver the SL&amp;RR program including the new ABI and LGBTIQ+ programs, in Central and East Gippsland \u2022 Promote the Gippsland SL&amp;RR network through free information \/ professional development sessions for the health, community, and disability sectors. Conduct sessions and engage Peer Educators as co-presenters. \u2022 Increase social and economic participation by Peer Educators\/self-advocates employed through NWG and include paid work for up to 12 Peer Educators.

However, the baseline treatment and the quality of study methodology for new treatment approaches have improved. This systematic review examined the evidence published in the past few decades on the effectiveness of MI on upper- and lower-extremity function and functional performance in patients with stroke. A total of 29 randomized controlled and crossover trials that compared MI with other interventions were analyzed. In addition, the outcomes were grouped into upper-, lower-extremity function, and functional performance for data analysis. More than half of the upper-extremity function studies reported improved performance in Fugl-Meyer assessment, Wolf motor function test, and box and block test in both acute and chronic stages. Lower-extremity function and functional performance were primarily investigated using Fugl-Meyer assessment, gait speed and parameters, activities of daily living, and balance ability. When considering only high-quality studies, six of 15 on upper extremity reported significant effects, whereas five of 15 reported nonsignificant effects. In addition, six of 14 studies on gait and balance reported significant effects. This systematic review suggests that both MI training and conventional rehabilitation programs effectively enhance upper limb functional abilities, including improvements in gait speed and balance, in individuals with acute and chronic stroke.

Because acidosis inhibits glycolytic metabolism and hypoxia inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells that survive and grow in these environments must rewire their metabolism and develop a high degree of metabolic plasticity to meet their energetic and biosynthetic demands. Cancer cells frequently upregulate pathways enabling the uptake and utilization of lipids and other nutrients derived from dead or recruited stromal cells, and in particular lipid uptake is strongly enhanced in acidic microenvironments. The resulting lipid accumulation and increased reliance on \u03b2-oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism increase susceptibility to oxidative stress, lipotoxicity, and ferroptosis, in turn driving changes that may mitigate such risks. The spatially and temporally heterogeneous tumor microenvironment thus selects for invasive, metabolically flexible, and resilient cancer cells capable of exploiting their local conditions and of seeking out more favorable surroundings. This phenotype relies on the interplay between metabolism, acidosis, and oncogenic mutations, driving metabolic signaling pathways such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Understanding the particular vulnerabilities of such cells may uncover novel therapeutic liabilities of the most aggressive cancer cells. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["American Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2174\/0929867331666230713165407","title":["Small Molecule Inhibitors of Human Papillomavirus: A Review of\nResearch from 1997 to 2021"],"author":[{"given":"Caitlin L.","family":"Duncan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA, 6845, Australia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3897-1948","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hendra","family":"Gunosewoyo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA, 6845, Australia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9514-7846","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Mauro","family":"Mocerino","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA, 6845, Australia"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4530-6348","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Alan D.","family":"Payne","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA, 6845, Australia"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>:<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the cause of warts, lesions and\ncancer, with different types of HPV causing different symptoms.

We therefore surveyed members of the Spanish-speaking community in the New York City area to gain insights into how the NWS two-page rip current informational brochure is working and possible improvements to be made. The English version of the brochure was also tested, and the results from the two languages were compared. Quantitative survey results indicate that while both brochures are generally effective, several changes could be made to improve clarity, especially for Spanish speakers, who found more issues with the Spanish version. For example, the translation of the term rip current itself used by the NWS, \u201ccorrientes de resaca,\u201d was determined to be confusing by some Spanish speakers, as were other pieces of text with complex scientific terms. Moreover, certain graphics contained in the brochure were difficult to understand for users in both languages. The results of this work can be used by the NWS and other agencies to improve their Spanish risk communication tools and can also be used as a guide when translating scientific information into other languages.<\/jats:p>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Significance Statement<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Rip currents, narrow channels of fast-moving water that can pull swimmers away from the shore, are among the leading weather-related killers in the United States yet are poorly understood by the public. Recent efforts to reduce society\u2019s vulnerability to rip currents include the translation of outreach materials from English to Spanish. This study evaluated a new National Weather Service Spanish rip current informational brochure and compared it to the English version. The results show that while both the English and Spanish brochures were generally effective at communicating risk, the Spanish version had more issues, primarily surrounding the translation of scientific terms and phrases. Findings from this research can help guide scientists in designing improved non-English severe weather outreach products.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","container-title":["Weather, Climate, and Society"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/iae.0000000000004165","title":["INTEREST OF REGULAR ASSAYS OF AQUEOUS HUMOR INTERLEUKIN-10 LEVELS IN MONITORING OF VITREORETINAL LYMPHOMA"],"author":[{"given":"Charline","family":"Metayer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"}]},{"given":"Laurent","family":"Kodjikian","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"},{"name":"Laboratoire UMR-CNRS 5510 MATEIS, INSA, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France;"}]},{"given":"Anh-Minh","family":"Nguyen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"},{"name":"Centre Ophtalmologique P\u00f4le Vision, Clinique du Val d\u2019Ouest, Ecully, France; and"}]},{"given":"Olivier","family":"Loria","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"}]},{"given":"Mayeul","family":"Chaperon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"}]},{"given":"Herv\u00e9","family":"Ghesquieres","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'H\u00e9matologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre-B\u00e9nite, France."}]},{"given":"Thibaud","family":"Mathis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Service d'Ophtalmologie, H\u00f4pital Universitaire de la Croix-Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France;"},{"name":"Laboratoire UMR-CNRS 5510 MATEIS, INSA, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France;"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Purpose:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>To investigate the variation of interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the aqueous humor (AH) of patients with vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) throughout therapy and follow-up and analyze the relation of these variations with VRL clinical course and relapse.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This study retrospectively included consecutive patients diagnosed with VRL in a single center.

Beginning by evocating the spirit of Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler and the caf\u00e9 culture of the 1940s, we move to consider a few of the most resonant poems of Goldberg, Zelda and Amichai, and examine the ways in which each of them, coming from elsewhere and writing in a particular idiom, invokes his\/her place of origin while embedding their resonant lines in the particular landscape of Jerusalem.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Jerusalem Transformed"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780197783214.003.0005","title":["The Wandering Hebrew University, 1914\u20131967"],"author":[{"given":"Assaf","family":"Selzer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Between the Years 1914 \u2013 1967 the Hebrew University of Jerusalem changed its location in the city.

The classical Morison equation is evaluated alongside an extended version to address limitations in predicting forces on geometrically complex structures. Mesh convergence studies are performed to select the optimum grid size for separate wave and current simulations. The focus is on test cases characterized by small Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) numbers and relatively high Reynolds (Re) numbers within both inertia-dominated and diffraction zones.  Numerical simulation results are utilized to compare the force predictions of the classical Morison equation and the extended Morison equation. It is observed that the classical Morison equation performs adequately for constant diameter piles, but it fails to predict forces on variable diameter piles accurately. In contrast, the extended Morison equation, incorporating nonlinear effects and variable cross-sections, provides significantly more accurate force predictions, particularly in the diffraction zone compared to the numerical simulations. This study emphasizes the critical importance of accounting for geometric variations, such as linearly varying pile diameters, under separate waves and currents loadings in hydrodynamic force calculations. These considerations support the development of enhanced design methods and optimization strategies, leading to safer and more efficient offshore structures.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Brodogradnja"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.54648\/cola2024092","title":["EU Environmental Principles and Scientific Uncertainty before National Courts: The Case of the Habitats Directive Edited by Mariolina Eliantonio, Emma Lees and Tiina Paloniitty (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2023)"],"author":[{"given":"Tuvana","family":"Aras","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:italic\/>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Common Market Law Review"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.54648\/cola2024081","title":["EU State aid and the tax allocation of multinationals\u2019 profits"],"author":[{"given":"A.","family":"Navarro","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"H.","family":"L\u00f3pez","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            <jats:italic>This contribution examines the impact of the EU prohibition of State aid over the tax allocation of multinationals\u2019 profits.

Although apparently neutral, such a standard may lead to prohibited aid both at the level of its regulatory design and its enforcement. These issues have been recently exacerbated due to the assessment of the \u201ctax rulings\u201d cases, i.e. State aid proceedings opened against the granting of individual, unpublished rulings by certain Member States to some of the largest multinationals operating in the EU, recently reviewed by the ECJ. Unlike most of the scholarly literature, which has focused on the specific issues raised in these cases, this article aims to comprehensively analyse the issues raised by the said regulations when confronted with the EU State aid regime, in line with the latest jurisprudence in this field. The examination starts by defining the aim and contradictions of the arm\u2019s length standard, which is necessary to build a proper reference framework against which deviations resulting in a selective advantage may be detected. Such derogations potentially resulting in prohibited aid may arise when assessing the scope of these regulations, the existence of specific regimes deviating from the arm\u2019s length standard rationale, and in the context of individual administrative acts (e.g. tax rulings) deviating from the content of the applicable transfer pricing regulations.<\/jats:italic>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Common Market Law Review"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.54648\/cola2024079","title":["Fundamental procedural rights and ECB banking supervision: An ECB Hearing Officer?P.

The acoustic emission (AE) method has already shown its excellent suitability for damage localization. However, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are often prevalent in SHM, thus an increase in localization accuracy and robustness is still in demand. The present study faces this task through the integration of various model knowledge for AE \n\nsource localization. The basis of the presented algorithm is the consideration of the dispersive behavior of elastic waves in thin-walled structures. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to obtain time-frequency representations of the signals, \n\nwhere frequency-dependent values for time-of-arrival (TOA) are extracted. \n\nFurthermore, the algorithm incorporates the knowledge that all sensors receive signals with the same time and location of origin, as well as the slightly different sensitivity of the theoretically equal sensors. The final localization results are achieved by a two parameter grid search optimization. The algorithm is experimentally tested on a large aluminum plate with four piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWASs) arranged in an array of 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm. The mean localization error of pencil lead breaks at ten different positions within the sensor array is used as an accuracy measure. It is shown that as more of the described model knowledge is incorporated into the localization, the accuracy increases. With the final algorithm, the mean localization error is more than halved compared to AE localization based on classical TOA estimation. \n\nAlthough the experiment described is conducted under laboratory conditions, the remarkable increase in accuracy suggests that AE source localization may be successful even at low SNR as typical for operational conditions.\n<\/jats:p>","container-title":["e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.58286\/30240","title":["Studies on a Mobile Acoustic Emission Sensor Verification Device"],"author":[{"name":"University of Augsburg","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Adelmo","family":"Fernandes De Oliveira Junior","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"University of Augsburg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7670-2429","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Thomas","family":"Schlech","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"University of Augsburg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6477-0691","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Markus G.

Another option is CEN ISO\/TR 13115, which needs a large volumetric propagation medium leading to similar practical limitations as for the ASTM standards. Many acoustic emission users try to fill the gap of calibration services by using simplified verification standards. However, there is currently no verification standard suitable for using in the field. In that sense, one ambition of the project CalibrAEte is to establish a new standard for primary and secondary calibration that can be implemented in laboratories without a huge invest. Another objective of the project is to establish a verification procedure using a device to verify acoustic emission sensors by a wave-based approach in the field. The proposed approach uses a durable propagation medium that carries the elastic waves from a repeatable source to the sensor under test. This research focuses on such a mobile verification device in the sense that an optimal configuration is proposed. This contribution will present the major aspects and details of an acoustic emission sensor verification setup that can be used not just in the laboratory environment but also in harsh field conditions. It will be shown the performance of the reference sensor developed for this purpose along with the setup itself, which was partially developed by aid of numerical methods.

A novel approach for field-testing is to measure the electromechanical impedance (EMI) of the AE sensor. This method requires minimal additional equipment and eliminates human interaction, which is needed for current field-tests like pencil-lead break tests. However, the EMI includes the mechanical impedances of the sensor, the coupling layer, and the structure. Therefore, the measurements contain information about all three and influences of the structure and the coupling layer need to be investigated to be able to establish a method for self-diagnosis in field. Additionally, the piezoelectric effect is temperature-dependent, which affects the measured EMI spectra and may result in erroneous assessments of the sensor's condition if not accounted for.\n\nThis work presents experimental studies on the influence of measuring equipment, environmental temperature, coupling-specific parameters and structural parameters on the EMI of AE sensors. Moreover, numerical simulations have been conducted to provide additional support and to extend the experimental studies of the latter two. To ensure reproducible sensor coupling to a structure, a setup was constructed to couple the sensor to the structure at the same position and with the same force. The thickness of the coupling layer is determined by a small amount of silicon carbide particles with a specific diameter. This setup is also used to examine the effect of structural parameters.\n<\/jats:p>","container-title":["e-Journal of Nondestructive Testing"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.22199\/issn.0717-6279-6252","title":["Rainbow Mean Index of Some Classes of Graphs"],"author":[{"given":"Maheswari","family":"K.","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0837-2127","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rajasekaran","family":"Ganapathy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In this article, we determine the rainbow mean index of cartesianproductG\u25fbPn, where G is a regular graph;Pm\u25fbPn; Wn\u25fbK2;total graph of paths; chain of cycles and complete graphs; triangular treeand join graphs tCs\u2228K1.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proyecciones (Antofagasta)"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2174\/0113892010282605231218064053","title":["Essential Oils of Some Potential Medicinal Plants and their Wound\nHealing Activities"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9429-2857","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Shiv","family":"Bahadur","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, 281406, India"}]},{"given":"Sana","family":"Fatima","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, GLA University, Mathura, 281406, India"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>:<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The wound has been recognised as a deep cut or tearing of the epidermis, which is\nalso referred to as trauma and harm to the body tissues.

The EU Competition Damages Directive (Damages Directive) sets the minimum standards of the right to full compensation and the cooperation of public and private enforcement in Member States. This contribution examines Articles 9(1) and 17(2) of the Damages Directive and considers whether similar provision could be applicable in MAR\u2019s private enforcement. This contribution finds that Articles 9(1) and 17(2) of the Damages Directive could be transposed into an issuer liability regime if the EU legislator were to harmonize issuer liability for inside information misstatements. Such provision would increase deterrence and decrease investor plaintiffs\u2019 litigation costs.R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Le R\u00e8glement europ\u00e9en sur les abus de march\u00e9 (MAR) oblige les \u00e9metteurs \u00e0 rendre publiques les informations privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es qui concernent directement lesdits \u00e9metteurs.

La mise en application du MAR repose principalement sur une application par les autorit\u00e9s publiques (public enforcement). La situation contraste avec la l\u00e9gislation europ\u00e9enne sur la concurrence. La Directive de l\u2019UE sur les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en cas de violation du droit de la concurrence (Damages Directive) \u00e9tablit les normes minimales du droit \u00e0 une enti\u00e8re indemnisation et la coop\u00e9ration entre l\u2019action publique et l\u2019action priv\u00e9e (public enforcement et private enforcement) dans les Etats membres. La pr\u00e9sente contribution examine les articles 9(1) et 17(2) de la Directive de l\u2019UE sur les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en cas de violation du droit de la concurrence et examine si une disposition similaire pourrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 une action priv\u00e9e (private enforcement) du MAR. La pr\u00e9sente contribution estime que les articles 9(1) et 17(2) de la Directive sur les dommagesint\u00e9r\u00eats en cas de violation du droit de la concurrence pourrait \u00eatre transpos\u00e9e dans un r\u00e9gime de responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9metteur si le l\u00e9gislateur de l\u2019UE venait \u00e0 harmoniser la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9metteur en cas d\u2019inexactitude d\u2019informations privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es.

Die Haftung f\u00fcr Falschangaben bez\u00fcglich Insiderinformationen ist in der EU nicht harmonisiert und die Mitgliedstaaten wenden unterschiedliche zivilrechtliche Haftungsbestimmungen auf Falschangaben von Insiderinformationen an. Die Durchsetzung der MAR beruht in erster Linie auf der \u00f6ffentlichen Durchsetzung. Anders hingegen sieht die Situation beim EU-Wettbewerbsrecht aus. Die EURichtlinie \u00fcber Schadenersatz im Wettbewerb (Schadenersatzrichtlinie) legt die rechtlichen Mindeststandards auf vollen Schadenersatz und die Zusammenarbeit der \u00f6ffentlichen und privaten Durchsetzung in den Mitgliedstaaten fest. Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht Artikel 9(1) und 17(2) der Schadenersatzrichtlinie und pr\u00fcft, ob eine \u00e4hnliche Bestimmung auf die private Durchsetzung der MAR anwendbar sein k\u00f6nnte. Der Beitrag kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass Artikel 9(1) und 17(2) der Schadensersatzrichtlinie in ein Emittentenhaftungsregime umgesetzt warden k\u00f6nnten, wenn der EU-Gesetzgeber die Emittentenhaftung f\u00fcr Falschangaben von Insiderinformationen harmonisieren w\u00fcrde. Eine solche Bestimmung w\u00fcrde die Abschreckung erh\u00f6hen und die Prozesskosten f\u00fcr die klagenden Anleger senken.Resumen: El Reglamento sobre Abuso de Mercado (MAR) de la UE obliga a los emisores a informar al p\u00fablico sobre la informaci\u00f3n privilegiada que les concierne directamente. La responsabilidad por informaciones err\u00f3neas de informaci\u00f3n privilegiada no est\u00e1 armonizada en la UE, y los Estados Miembros aplican diferentes disposiciones de responsabilidad civil a las informaciones err\u00f3neas de informaci\u00f3n privilegiada. La aplicaci\u00f3n del MAR depende principalmente de las autoridades. La situaci\u00f3n contrasta con la legislaci\u00f3n de competencia de la UE. La Directiva de Da\u00f1os por infracciones al Derecho de la Competencia de la UE (Directiva de Da\u00f1os) establece los est\u00e1ndares m\u00ednimos del derecho a una compensaci\u00f3n \u00edntegra y la cooperaci\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y privada en los Estados miembros. Esta contribuci\u00f3n examina los art\u00edculos 9(1) y 17(2) de la Directiva de Da\u00f1os y considera si podr\u00eda aplicarse una disposici\u00f3n similar en la ejecuci\u00f3n privada del MAR. Esta contribuci\u00f3n concluye que los art\u00edculos 9(1) y 17(2) de la Directiva sobre Da\u00f1os podr\u00edan trasladarse a un r\u00e9gimen de responsabilidad del emisor si el legislador de la UE armonizara la responsabilidad del emisor por inexactitudes en la informaci\u00f3n privilegiada.

At the same time, it becomes just as common for thee data subjects to have access to what is stored about them, sometimes via a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d, as the GDPR names it in Article 15. In this context, Case C-307\/22 (founded on such a request from a patient against their dentist) delineated when abusive data subject access requests occur, including the limits of the data controller\u2019s refusal to comply with it or the decision to charge for the act of complying.As part of the case, the CJEU pinpointed the solution for the conflict between the GDPR and the German data protection implementation law, the reiteration of Recitals\u2019 value in terms of GDPR applicability and the right of access as a tool in triggering medical liability. Correspondingly, the case note will explore the repercussions of this case at both doctrinal and legislative level, since the decision\u2019s interpretation may come into conflict with national data protection laws.On this point,Greece and France will be the relevant jurisdictions for the analysis, since Article 12 of the GDPR was slightly amended in their data protection laws by introducing the concept of \u201cabusive\u201d requests. Furthermore, the implications towards Private Lawwill also be addressed, with particular focus onContract Law, Property LawandTort Law.Substantially, the case note depicts how inconsistency may arise from attempted consistency, compelling the data protection legal apparatus to restructuring.<\/jats:italic>\n          <\/jats:p>","container-title":["European Review of Private Law"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.62560\/csz.2024.04.4","title":["Hazai egyetemi k\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9gi szerepv\u00e1llal\u00e1si gyakorlatok a t\u00e1rsadalmi igazs\u00e1goss\u00e1g lencs\u00e9j\u00e9n kereszt\u00fcl"],"author":[{"given":"Gy\u00f6rgy","family":"M\u00e1lovics","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Napjainkban az egyetemek ir\u00e1ny\u00e1ba alapvet\u0151 t\u00e1rsadalmi elv\u00e1r\u00e1s, hogy bizony\u00edts\u00e1k t\u00e1rsadalmi hasznoss\u00e1gukat.

Sodium reabsorption in this region is often linked to the actions of aldosterone, although in recent years numerous findings have been reported on the aldosterone-independent pathway of acquiring salt sensitivity by potassium deficiency or potassium loading. The key to this discussion is the interplay, through extracellular potassium concentration, between the first part of the tubules expressing the Na<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>-Cl<jats:sup>\u2212<\/jats:sup> cotransporter (NCC) and the second part expressing the epithelial Na<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> channel (ENaC). The molecular pathways such as with-no-lysine 1 (WNK)-STE20\/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK)\/oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) signaling, Kelch-like family member 3 (KLHL3)-cullin 3 (CUL3) complex, protein phosphatases, and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Nedd4L pathway are described as the mechanism by which salt sensitivity on blood pressure is acquired in response to changes in physiological conditions including potassium depletion or loading. This review highlights the potential for targeting these molecular pathways to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension, the mechanism of which remains to be elucidated. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.59641\/tt812wf","title":["Metaaltijden (vol. 11).

Markov decision processes with stochastic dynamics are formulated for RL. To overcome the problem of low terminal accuracy in RL-based transfer trajectory design, robust zero-effort-miss\/zero-effort-velocity (R-ZEM\/ZEV) guidance is proposed. Originally, an eigenvalue-related term is defined according to the stability conditions of the ZEM\/ZEV feedback system and chosen as the learning parameter, which can significantly improve the robustness of the agent to process uncertainties under the low-thrust magnitude constraint. Moreover, the navigation performance of the asteroid approaching is modeled via the Fisher information matrix and incorporated in the reward function design, which enables optimizing the optical observation performance together with the propellant cost. Thereafter, the proximal policy optimization is adopted to train an RL agent that can efficiently deal with the uncertainties. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through simulations of a low-thrust spacecraft approaching the asteroid Bennu. The promising results indicate that the proposed method can not only deal with various uncertainties efficiently and autonomously but can also guarantee high terminal accuracy. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/j.jcrs.0000000000001505","title":["Effectiveness and safety of a novel crosslinked hyaluronate canalicular gel occlusive device for dry eye"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2681-6641","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mark","family":"Packer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Richard","family":"Lindstrom","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vance","family":"Thompson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-0364-1531","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jai G.","family":"Parekh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0895-7870","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Preeya","family":"Gupta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lisa M.","family":"Nijm","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eric","family":"Donnenfeld","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Purpose:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a crosslinked hyaluronate (HA) canalicular filler (Lacrifill Canalicular Gel) compared with a commercially available hydrogel canalicular plug (Form Fit).<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Setting:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>5 sites in the United States.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Design:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Prospective, multicenter, controlled, double-masked, randomized 2:1 (filler:plug).<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods:<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Adults (\u226522 years) with the Schirmer test (with anesthesia) \u226410 mm\/5 minutes, presence of corneal staining, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) of \u226523 with \u22643 responses of \u201cnot applicable,\u201d patent lacrimal drainage system, and bilateral corrected distance visual acuity of 20\/40 or better.

Two CubeSats onboard Hera plan to perform a ballistic landing on the secondary of the system, called Dimorphos. For these types of landings the translational state during descent is not controlled, reducing the spacecraft\u2019s complexity but also increasing its sensitivity to deployment maneuver errors and dynamic uncertainties. This paper introduces a novel methodology to analyze the effect of these uncertainties on the dynamics of the lander and design a trajectory that is robust against them. This methodology consists of propagating the uncertain state of the lander using the nonintrusive Chebyshev interpolation (NCI) technique, which approximates the uncertain dynamics using a polynomial expansion. The results are then analyzed using the pseudo-diffusion indicator. This indicator is derived from the coefficients of the polynomial expansion, which quantifies the rate of growth of the set of possible states of the spacecraft over time. The indicator is used here to constrain the impact velocity and angle to values that allow for successful settling on the surface. This information is then used to optimize the landing trajectory by applying the NCI technique inside the transcription of the problem. The resulting trajectory increases the robustness of the trajectory compared to a conventional method, improving landing success by 20% and significantly reducing the landing footprint. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1097\/j.jcrs.0000000000001529","title":["Decreased vision due to scarring after phototherapeutic keratectomy"],"author":[{"given":"Rudy M.M.A.","family":"Nuijts","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Robin C.I.","family":"Ollivier","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Simona","family":"Schlereth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Claus","family":"Cursiefen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Massimo","family":"Busin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Angeli Christy","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jorge","family":"Ali\u00f3","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vincent","family":"Borderie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rohit","family":"Shetty","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Harsha","family":"Nagaraja","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Swaminathan","family":"Sethu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>In May 2023, a 36-year-old carpenter complained of a sudden decrease in visual acuity in both eyes after his fourth COVID-19 vaccination.

The structures were subjected to seven near-fault earthquakes in longitudinal and transverse directions, once with the fling-step pulse included and once with it removed. The results showed that fling step has a noticeable effect on the seismic response indicators investigated, but may increase or decrease the seismic demand. The maximum curvature in the presence of fling step in relation to that without fling step ranged between 0.54 and 2.06. Unseating in the longitudinal direction was most sensitive to the fling step, and showed a more than 200% increase in some cases. Effects of the fling step were correlated with the ratio of the period of the fundamental mode of vibration of the structure to that of the fling-step pulse. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Structures and Buildings"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1595\/205651325x17176890228217","title":["Active Sites of Cu\/ZnO-Based Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol: Part II"],"author":[{"given":"Mustafa Al","family":"Salmi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Petroleum Development Oman, PO Box 81, Muscat, Oman"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Part II of this review continues to explore the connection between Cu\/ZnO-based catalysts properties and methanol synthesis activity.

Saprolite has 53.1 wt% iron oxide\/oxyhydroxide, 38.3 wt% lizardite and 8.7 wt% silicate. According to DTA, saprolite undergoes a phase shift from goethite to haematite at low temperatures (200\u2013300\u00b0C). This is a suitable phase to optimise nickel diffusion in iron.

Characterisation of aluminium-oxygen coordination is thus important to understand how catalysts interact with alumina at the microscopic level.

The first technique is electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) that can reveal detailed electronic structure profile of aluminium valence band to analyse how aluminium is coordinated by oxygen.

The strong (weak) zonal circulation over East Asia led to positive (negative) surface air temperature anomalies (SATAs) during P1 and P2 (P3). The position of the Siberian high affected the distribution of the warmest center of SATA over northeastern and northwestern China in P1 and P2, respectively. Further investigations indicated that intraseasonal components (10\u201390 days) primarily drove the warm-to-cold transition in China during P2 and P3, contributing to 79.5% of the variance in SATA in winter 2021\/22. Strong (weak) East Asian intraseasonal zonal circulations and positive (negative) meridional wind anomalies over China\u2013Lake Baikal led to warm (cold) anomalies over China during P2 (P3). East Asian circulation alternations from P2 to P3 were associated with a shift in intraseasonal geopotential height anomalies over the North Atlantic region from positive to negative in the mid- to high troposphere through the propagation of north and south branch wave trains. The reversal of the North Atlantic geopotential height anomalies between P2 and P3 was modulated by intraseasonal higher-latitude SST anomalies over the North Atlantic and the location of intraseasonal stratospheric polar vortex. Furthermore, the intensified south branch wave train from the Indian Peninsula to China in the mid- to high troposphere was associated with active convection over the tropical western Indian Ocean during P3. These processes could be verified by using the linear baroclinic model.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Climate"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1175\/jcli-d-24-0072.1","title":["Impact of Summer North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature Tripole on Precipitation over Mid\u2013High-Latitude Eurasia"],"author":[{"given":"Shanling","family":"Cheng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9333-2359","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Haipeng","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"b Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science and Frozen Soil Engineering, Nagqu Plateau Climate and Environment Observation and Research Station of Tibet Autonomous Region, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Jie","family":"Zhou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Bofei","family":"Zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"b Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science and Frozen Soil Engineering, Nagqu Plateau Climate and Environment Observation and Research Station of Tibet Autonomous Region, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, China"},{"name":"c University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"}]},{"given":"Yu","family":"Ren","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Hongyu","family":"Luo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"b Key Laboratory of Cryospheric Science and Frozen Soil Engineering, Nagqu Plateau Climate and Environment Observation and Research Station of Tibet Autonomous Region, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, China"},{"name":"c University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"}]},{"given":"Siyu","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Yongqi","family":"Gong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Ming","family":"Peng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]},{"given":"Yunsai","family":"Zhu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"a Key Laboratory for Semi-Arid Climate Change of the Ministry of Education, College of Atmospheric Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>Eurasia is a sensitive and high-risk region for global climate changes, where climate anomalies significantly influence natural ecosystems, human health, and economic development. The North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature anomaly is crucial to interannual precipitation variations in Eurasia. Several studies have focused on the link between the NAT and climate anomalies in winter and spring. However, the mechanism by which the summer NAT impacts climate anomalies in Eurasia remains unclear. This study examines how the NAT impacts interannual variations of summer precipitation in mid\u2013high-latitude Eurasia. Precipitation variations are associated with the atmospheric teleconnection triggered by the NAT. When the NAT is in its positive phase, the anomalous atmospheric diabatic heating over the North Atlantic excites an equivalent-barotropic Rossby wave train response that propagates eastward toward Eurasia, resulting in atmospheric circulation anomalies over the region. The combined effects of atmospheric circulation, radiative forcing, and water vapor transport anomalies lead to decreased precipitation across northern Europe and central Eurasia, with higher precipitation anomalies over northeast Asia. Finally, numerical experiments verify that the summer NAT excites atmospheric teleconnections that propagate downstream, affecting precipitation anomalies in mid\u2013high-latitude Eurasia. This study provides a scientific basis for predicting Eurasian summer precipitation and strengthening disaster management strategies.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Climate"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.52200\/docomomo.books.01","title":["Landscape Architecture and Infrastructure of the Twentieth Century"],"author":[{"given":"Gulnur","family":"Cengiz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>This book presents a wide range of landscapes that have been integral to the Modern Movement era.

This essay argues that this is a misreading. Instead, the essay addresses polarization between those who are pro-diversity (possibly also pro-immigration) and those who fear that their national identities are being demoted at the expense of other identities. The clash is not between universalism and identitarianism but over the value or recognition to be accorded to different group identities. While multiculturalism has been concerned with the normative status of minority identities, it has been counterposed, sometimes aggressively, by those who bemoan the neglect of majorities and their identity-based anxieties. This essay focuses on how we can tackle and lessen the polarization that is fostering mutual distrust and threatening the national, democratic citizenships upon which any multiculturalist, egalitarian, and unifying project must be built, and which multiculturalists, together with others, must defend. This involves developing a multicultural national identity to which all citizens can have a sense of belonging without giving up other identities that are important to them. Such national and group identities should not be conceived as monistic or static but rather as interactive and dialogical. Such a sense of the national allows one to be sensitive to minority-identity vulnerabilities and majority-identity anxieties within an integrated theoretical and political framework.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Journal of Democracy"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1024\/1012-5302\/a001000","title":["Die Umsetzung des klinischen Assessments durch Pflegefachpersonen in der Schweiz"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0852-1412","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marius","family":"M\u00f6ller","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institut Pflege, Departement Gesundheit, Z\u00fcrcher                Hochschule f\u00fcr Angewandte Wissenschaften, Winterthur,                   Schweiz"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9088-4238","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Uta Christine","family":"Grosse","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institut Pflege, Departement Gesundheit, Z\u00fcrcher                Hochschule f\u00fcr Angewandte Wissenschaften, Winterthur,                   Schweiz"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2785-3241","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Veronika","family":"Waldboth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institut Pflege, Departement Gesundheit, Z\u00fcrcher                Hochschule f\u00fcr Angewandte Wissenschaften, Winterthur,                   Schweiz"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> Zusammenfassung: Hintergrund: Das klinische Assessment z\u00e4hlt zu den Kernkompetenzen von BScN- und MScN-Pflegefachpersonen in der Schweiz.

Methode: Ein explorativ deskriptives Forschungsdesign in Form einer Querschnittsstudie der Gelegenheitsstichprobe aus BScN- und MScN-Absolvent_innen wurde genutzt. 264 Frageb\u00f6gen wurden quantitativ und 149 offene Antworten des Surveys qualitativ ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: Nur 18,9% der 53 erlernten Assessments kommen routinem\u00e4\u00dfig zum Einsatz. Die Systeme \u201eRespiratorisches System\u201c, \u201eAbdomen\u201c und \u201eHaut\u201c sowie der \u201eMentale Status\u201c wurden am h\u00e4ufigsten angewandt. MScN-Absolvent_innen wenden die respiratorischen Assessments und BScN-Absolvent_innen die des Abdomens h\u00e4ufiger an. Zeitmangel und Unterbrechungen, mangelnder Einfluss auf die Patient_innenversorgung und fachspezifische Untersuchungsskills limitierten die Anwendung. Bessere institutionelle Rahmenbedingungen sowie Wertsch\u00e4tzung im interprofessionellen Team k\u00f6nnten zuk\u00fcnftig einen f\u00f6rderlichen Beitrag leisten. Schlussfolgerung: Diese Studie verdeutlicht, dass der Theorie-Praxis-Transfer des klinischen Assessments in der Schweiz weiter gef\u00f6rdert werden muss. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Pflege"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1123\/jtpe.2023-0090","title":["Students\u2019 Perspectives of Social and Emotional Learning in a High School Physical Education Program"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5460-4836","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Ben","family":"Dyson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3621-3011","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Seunghyun","family":"Baek","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State University of New York at Cortland, Cortland, NY, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3534-6768","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Donal","family":"Howley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Towson University, Towson, MD, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6301-7203","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Yongjin","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA"}]},{"given":"Judy","family":"Fowler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p><jats:italic><jats:bold>Purpose:<\/jats:bold><\/jats:italic> This study aimed to explore students\u2019 perspectives and experiences of social and emotional learning (SEL) during physical education high school classes.<jats:italic> <jats:bold>Method:<\/jats:bold><\/jats:italic> Using a case study design, focus group and individual interviews were implemented with 42 students.

However, garlic powder (GP) is used to treat many diseases, such as heart and lung diseases.  Objectives: This study investigated the effects of GP supplementary diet on apoptosis and right ventricle hypertrophy in broiler chickens with PHS.  Methods: Ninety meat-type chickens were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, PHS and PHS+GP. The PHS was induced by triiodothyronine (T3) in broiler chickens, and GP was added to the ration after week 1 of rearing (PHS+GP). Then, lung and ventricle tissues were collected at 21 and 49 days of age. PHS was calculated at 21 and 49 days based on the ratio of the right ventricle to the total ventricles (RV\/TV) weight index. Gene expression of caspase1 (CASP1) and caspase1 (CASP2) were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in the lungs and right heart ventricles.  Results: The findings showed that right ventricular hypertrophy increased at day 49 in the PHS group compared to sham (P&lt;0.001), while garlic consumption decreased this ratio to the control level (P&lt;0.05). Also, the expression of CASP1 and CASP2 in the lungs elevated on day 49 (P&lt;0.001), and the GP diet prevented this increase (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, in the right ventricle tissue, PHS affected CASP1 on days 21 and 49, although the expression of CASP2 significantly increased just at day 49 in the PHS group (P&lt;0.001). This increase in both times was weakened by garlic consumption (P&lt;0.05).

Methods: Sixteen Holstein lactating cows were used for our experiment in four treatment groups: Basal diet without heat stress alleviation methods (control), zinc supplementation in diet, basal diet and application of mist spray method and supplementation of zinc in basal diet with mist spray. We measured milk production and composition, blood parameters and HSP70 gene expression in all cows. Results: The results showed that the cows in the mist and zinc+mist treatments had significantly better performance and temperature-humidity index than the control group. The milk yield and its compounds were significantly affected by experimental treatments, with the best results seen in the treatment with both spray and zinc. The cows exposed to dry and lactation periods showed a significant increase in the concentration of blood biochemical factors and antioxidant indices in response to heat stress. HSP70 gene expression was significantly decreased in all treatments compared to the control. Conclusion: This experiment suggests that applying nutritional and management strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of heat stress on dairy cows.

In such a situation, crises such as the epidemic of COVID-19, which caused significant economic and social disparities can double the problems. To fully understand the wide-ranging impact of school closures, the transition to online education, and the recognition and support of mental health concerns, it is crucial that we carefully examine the lasting effects of the pandemic. Methods: The literature review played a crucial role in providing background information for this study. To gather academic literature, we extensively searched the PubMed and Scopus databases, including terms: \u201cCOVID-19\u201d AND (\u201clearning\u201d OR \u201clearning disorder\u201d OR \u201clearning disability\u201d). From initially n = 173 studies only n = 64 studies remained for the literature review. Discussion: We present a comprehensive strategy to address the deleterious effects of Covid-19 on learning difficulties. The disparities faced by people with learning difficulties across different socio-economic groups increased after the pandemic. Individuals with learning difficulties often experience unique mental health challenges that require tailored support. Providing professional assistance is crucial to ensuring academic success for students with learning difficulties, as it allows us to fully consider the significant changes in education and tailor our support accordingly. This will empower them to surpass their obstacles and flourish in their efforts. <\/jats:p>","container-title":["Lernen und Lernst\u00f6rungen"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.52734\/rcai7291","title":["Sakkyndige psykologers refleksjoner om Barnesakkyndig kommisjons kvalitetssikrende funksjon"],"author":[{"given":"Dag \u00d8.","family":"Nordanger","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Magne","family":"M\u00e6hle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"\u00d8ivin","family":"Christiansen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tone","family":"J\u00f8rgensen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vibeke","family":"Samsonsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hanne C.","family":"Braarud","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The future of many vulnerable children depends on the quality of child welfare decisions, where reports from independent child welfare experts may carry considerable weight.

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of perceptual-motor exercises based on multi-sensory therapy on body image and sensory processing in elderly individuals with cognitive impairments. Methods &amp; Materials The present study is a clinical trial with a pre-test-post-test design with an experimental and a control group, conducted in a double-blind manner. The samples were selected using the available sampling method and were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups (15 participants in each group). The interventions were performed individually for each participant in 8 treatment sessions, 2 days a week, for a duration of 1 month. The assessment tools included the multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire (MBSRQ) and the sensory profile questionnaire. Results The results showed that the perceptual-motor exercises based on multi-sensory therapy had a significant difference in all cases of the MBSRQ (except for body satisfaction and preoccupation with excess body) and the sensory profile questionnaire in both groups (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, the analysis of covariance in both questionnaires and in both groups was calculated to be less than 0.05 and significant. Conclusion The findings of this study showed that perceptual-motor exercises based on multi-sensory methods can improve body image and enhance sensory processing skills in elderly individuals with cognitive impairments. Therefore, educating and repeating these exercises can greatly assist therapists and clients in achieving more beneficial results.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Salmand"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.29333\/ejmste\/15199","title":["Educational robotics and primary school mathematics teaching: An analysis of pre-service teachers didactic-mathematical knowledge"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1866-1283","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ricardo","family":"Silva","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Escola de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Universidade de Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, PORTUGAL"},{"name":"CIDTFF\u2013Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Did\u00e1tica e Tecnologia na Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Formadores, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL"},{"name":"Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra, Escola Superior de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9962-562X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cec\u00edlia","family":"Costa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Escola de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Universidade de Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, PORTUGAL"},{"name":"CIDTFF\u2013Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Did\u00e1tica e Tecnologia na Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de Formadores, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, PORTUGAL"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9394-7724","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Yelitza","family":"Freitas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra, Escola Superior de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1812-2300","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Fernando","family":"Martins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra, Escola Superior de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL"},{"name":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Delega\u00e7\u00e3o da Covilh\u00e3, Covilh\u00e3, PORTUGAL"},{"name":"inED\u2013Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Inova\u00e7\u00e3o em Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0246-7398","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Manuel","family":"Cebri\u00e1n-de-la-Serna","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Catedr\u00e1tico de Tecnolog\u00eda Educativa, Universidad de M\u00e1laga, M\u00e1laga, SPAIN"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The scarcity of studies dedicated to the integration of educational robotics (ER) in teaching mathematical content, and the discomfort of teachers when integrating ER in their teaching practices make it pertinent to understand the development of the didactic knowledge of mathematics necessary to integrate ER in mathematics teaching practices during initial teacher training.

This paper presents practical examples of such innovations from the University of Health Sciences (UHS) in Cambodia\u2019s experiences, followed by discussions on enabled and hindered factors of their initiation, implementation, and sustainability. This paper also aims to inspire future medical education innovations. \nMethods: This paper relied on internal document reviews, including strategic plans, project proposals &amp; planning, course syllabi, and evaluation reports, and the collective working experiences of co-authors in initiating, implementing, and leading these innovations.\nResults: Three innovative projects at UHS illustrated how creative ideas are put into practice, including (1) The elective International Programme (IP) with a dual objective of training local trainers while preparing students for international mobility, (2) The Master of Health Professions Education (MHPE), a cost-effective faculty development programme delivered in-person at UHS campus by faculty of a university partner, and (3) Peer-assisted Learning (PAL), a student-led initiative to promote learning skills.\nConclusion: Medical education innovations are needed in resource-limited contexts. The success of these initiatives resulted from multi-factors, notably long-term strategic planning, supportive leadership, active partnerships, policy commitment, local champions, resourcefulness, and student engagement. The late adoption of technology-enhanced learning, the necessity for robust faculty development programmes, and early investment in student leaders, coupled with post-graduate retention planning, represent challenges that present strategic opportunities.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["The Asia Pacific Scholar"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1364\/prj.541511","title":["<i>Photonics Research<\/i> Interview with Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0951-6428","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hao","family":"Sun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Tsinghua University"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain discusses her career in semiconductor optoelectronics with her former student, Prof. Hao Sun.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Photonics Research"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1108\/ijwbr-04-2024-0015","title":["Exploring the hierarchy of motivations in the wine purchase behavior of Chinese young wine consumers"],"author":[{"given":"Dingkang","family":"Peng","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chia-Hsing","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper aims to explore the hierarchy of motivations behind Chinese young wine consumers\u2019 wine-purchasing behavior.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study used a random and snowball sampling technique to collect data from Chinese young wine consumers.

Briefly, whereas Leibniz defines substance in terms of activity, Wolff retains a broadly scholastic and Cartesian conception of substance as that which per se subsists and sustains accidents. One consequence of this difference is that it leads Wolff to interpret Leibniz\u2019s concept of a constantly striving force as denoting a feature of substance separate from its static powers, and not as their replacement. For Wolff, powers are essential possibilities of acting in subjects suited for independent existence. Force is a further ingredient that provides a reason for the contingent operation of powers.

Here, we realize a configurable microcavity\u2013antenna-integrated graphene photothermoelectric (PTE) THz detector. Through the microcavity\u2013antenna hybrid structure, THz radiations are localized and enhanced at one end of the graphene channel, and the temperature difference along the channel is greatly increased, resulting in the strong enhancement of PTE response.

Estimation of flow-related petrophysical properties from borehole geophysical measurements is challenging in the presence of spatially heterogeneous rocks. Core measurements are usually regarded as ground truth for inferring in-situ petrophysical properties but are typically sparsely sampled or non-existent. Modern machine-learning methods enable new strategies to estimate permeability from well logs and achieve accurate results, hence mitigating the lack of densely sampled core measurements.  We document best practices for permeability estimation from well logs and core data by comparing results obtained with both machine-learning (ML) methods and conventional petrophysical models. The new interpretation workflow incorporates the usage of latent-space well logs to estimate permeability at the resolution of core samples and well logs, while uncertainty is quantified as part of the process.  Data preprocessing is paramount to successfully applying ML methods to well-log interpretation. We preprocessed core data acquired in key wells that incorporate expert knowledge, depth-matched core porosity with log-calculated porosity, interpolated triple-combo well logs to core depth, and performed feature engineering on the resulting data suite. To generate latent-space well logs, dimensionality reduction techniques were implemented, such as principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), and deep-learning-based autoencoders, from which models were trained to estimate permeability. From the latent-space models, we performed regression using random forest, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network (ANN), and the Timur-Coates model to estimate the logarithm of permeability from core porosity and well logs (gamma ray, bulk density, neutron porosity, and photoelectric factor). Finally, the uncertainty of the estimated permeability was calculated based on the validation variance function for the test set. Comparisons of performance among the various estimation methods were performed based on the relative standard error of permeability estimations. To reach general conclusions, the methods were tested on data sets from a variety of carbonate and clastic (shaly and clean) rocks, both conventional and unconventional.  Results indicate that random forest and artificial neural networks best estimate permeability from triple-combo well logs across a wide range of permeability variations (0.001 to 2,000 md) with an average of 16% relative standard error when using the original well logs. Estimations improve when using latent-space well logs with discrete wavelet transforms. ML algorithms reduced the error to less than 13%, while implementing a fully connected autoencoder resulted in less than 10% error using the core-resolved support system. We obtained 5% average permeability estimation errors at well-log resolution, a 50% further decrease compared to the core support. The Timur-Coates model\/approach is the most reliable for data sets with a priori information about irreducible water saturation, yielding less than 22% relative standard error. Yet, prior data classification is required to improve estimation accuracy. Estimation workflows proved generalizable, as they can be used for permeability estimation in conventional and unconventional reservoirs.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Petrophysics \u2013 The SPWLA Journal of Formation Evaluation and Reservoir Description"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1364\/prj.528109","title":["Broadband continuous-wave mid-infrared wavelength conversion in high-<i>Q<\/i> silicon microring resonators"],"author":[{"given":"Zhiwei","family":"Yan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Qiyuan","family":"Yi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Qiyuan","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Guanglian","family":"Cheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Shuai","family":"Cui","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Lipeng","family":"Xia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"ShanghaiTech University"}]},{"given":"Fanglu","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Xinzhe","family":"Xiong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"given":"Zengfan","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4825-5163","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Shuang","family":"Zheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7400-5064","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Yuan","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7675-8542","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Yi","family":"Zou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"ShanghaiTech University"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7502-3643","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Li","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/00p991c53","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>The four-wave mixing (FWM) effect offers promise to generate or amplify light at wavelengths where achieving substantial gain is challenging, particularly within the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range.

Besides the more conventional sampling by core plugs and whole cores for measurements, the probe permeameter (sometimes called a mini-permeameter) has provided an alternative, nondestructive method to assess permeability. Application of the probe permeameter, however, may require some care before useful results can be obtained.  In this study, we describe the testing and modifications of a commercially available probe permeameter. We identify some limitations and propose two modifications. With the modified device, a core from the Lower Wilcox Formation, onshore Texas, USA, is evaluated for the purposes of assessing CO2 injectivity and trapping in the formation.  We find that systematic testing of the probe improved understanding of its response and offers a guide for evaluating any probe permeameter. Problems reported in a prior published study can be remedied, making the probe a reliable device that can measure permeabilities in the range of 0.023 to 760 md. We found problems caused by surface impairment, likely due to the long-term storage of the studied core, which reduced probe permeabilities in the more permeable intervals. We devised an adjustment to the readings to address this issue. We find grain size to be a major control of permeability in the non-marine section of the core (e.g., the fluvial-dominated distributary channels), but grain size has a weaker effect on the marine intervals (e.g., the wave-dominated delta front). CO2 injectivity is predicted to be best in the non-marine intervals (i.e., fluvial facies), but trapping is likely to be modest. Better trapping but reduced injectivity is expected to occur in the marine intervals.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Petrophysics \u2013 The SPWLA Journal of Formation Evaluation and Reservoir Description"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.30632\/pjv65n5-2024a2","title":["A Method for Reconstructing In-Situ Saturation Based on Dean-Stark Saturation Measured in Laboratory"],"author":[{"name":"Tianjin Branch of CNOOC Limited","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jiansheng","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sainan","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Tianjin Branch of CNOOC Limited","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yunlong","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Tianjin Branch of CNOOC Limited","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yi","family":"Qi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Tianjin Branch of CNOOC Limited","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yang","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Tianjin Branch of CNOOC Limited","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Sealed coring technology has been widely used in the Bohai Bay Basin in the past decades. The temperature and pressure changes experienced by the core from in-place borehole to lab conditions generate inconsistencies between the measured and the in-place saturations. In the Bohai Bay Basin, the as-received air-filled saturation measured in a laboratory has reached 10 ~ 30%, leading to significant uncertainty when using measured saturation to calibrate log-derived saturation.  Saturation correction must be performed when attempting to assess the risks, economics, and potential of a targeted resource play. It is commonly assumed that the void space at surface was previously occupied by hydrocarbons. However, this statement clearly overestimates the content of hydrocarbons, especially in waterflood intervals where there is a simultaneous loss of oil and water. The influence of montmorillonite dehydration on Dean-Stark saturation has not been extensively investigated. Although physical experiments can simulate the effects of degasification on fluid saturations, they are not practical for vendors and operators due to their lengthy duration.  Too much attention has been focused on updating coring technology and saturation measurement methods, while the key question has been neglected: How has the core saturation changed due to the temperature and pressure changes? The interlayer water of montmorillonite bleeds from the core at high temperatures. The volume of pores and fluids changes as the core is brought to the surface. Some of the fluids in the pore space get volatile because of degasification. All these phenomena can lead to errors in laboratory saturation. This manuscript presents a workflow that includes correction models for pore volume expansion, clay dehydration, and degasification to bridge the gap between measured and in-situ saturations. The corrected saturation shows a good agreement with log-derived and air-mercury injection saturations, indicating the effectiveness of the workflow. Compared with the measured water saturation from standard practice, the corrected water saturation increased by an average of 7.4 saturation units (s.u.) and was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.0268 &lt; 0.05). The workflow is based on experiments that were conducted on hydrophilic clay-quartz samples, so the application of the workflow is limited by the wettability and lithology of the formation.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Petrophysics \u2013 The SPWLA Journal of Formation Evaluation and Reservoir Description"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.1152\/japplphysiol.00354.2024","title":["Androgen receptor markers do not differ between nonresponders and responders to resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy"],"author":[{"given":"Jo\u00e3o G.

Characterization of water sources showed the following: RO had trace minerals; TW had the greatest potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg); and WW had greatest sulfur (S), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl). No water source had detectable heavy metals. Mineral and heavy metal tissue contents were determined at mid-harvest and end-harvest, and nutrient budgets for nitrogen (N), S, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl were calculated. Water sources did not impact lettuce growth during the 4-week hydroponic production cycle based on leaf greenness, diameter, fresh weight, or dry weight.

The Cl and Na levels in WW were 106 and 203 mg\u00b7L<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup>, respectively, and the electrical conductivity (EC) of this treatment increased to 3.5 dS\u00b7m<jats:sup>\u22121<\/jats:sup> after 4 weeks; however, plant water uptake, water use efficiency, and percent moisture loss were unaffected. In shoot tissue, lettuce grown with WW had less Ca at mid-harvest and less Mg at mid-harvest and end-harvest compared with other treatments, suggesting antagonization of uptake by high salt. Tissue S was not different across treatments; however, there were differences in reservoirs of the water sources as S accumulated more from WW. Tissue Na and Cl levels were different among the treatments, and higher amounts in nutrient reservoirs translated to higher uptake by lettuce. Although the heavy metal content in all water sources was &lt;0.01 ppm, arsenic, lead, and chromium were measured in lettuce tissue at levels that exceed recommended limits in most instances.

Winecups (<jats:italic>Callirhoe involucrata<\/jats:italic>) is an attractive native plant, valued for its long period of bloom, drought tolerance, and winterhardiness, but can be difficult to propagate from seeds and vegetative cuttings. Seed dormancy issues can result in unreliable germination and seedling variations, which reduces crop uniformity. Although propagation from rooted cuttings maintains crop uniformity, cuttings often fail to root or root poorly. Manipulating the growing conditions of stock plants to suppress reproductive growth may improve rooting success of vegetative cuttings. Based on research conducted earlier with other ornamental perennials and programmed photoperiods, winecups plants were grown under three programmed photoperiods to determine if a particular photoperiod could be used to suppress reproductive growth and promote vegetative growth. The study consisted of three experiments, all conducted in similar fashion but at different times during the year. Results indicate that plants grown under 10-hour and 8-hour photoperiods remained vegetative longer when compared with plants grown under 12-hour photoperiod. Vegetative cuttings harvested from plants grown under 8-hour photoperiod had higher percent rooting when compared with vegetative cuttings harvested from plants grown under 10-hour and 12-hour photoperiods.

Beyond RA and psoriatic arthritis, methotrexate is used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and other inflammatory conditions.

Although there is increasing evidence that immune disorders, particularly those associated with connective tissue diseases, are a strong predisposing factor in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), there is currently a lack of knowledge about the detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Exploring this topic is crucial because patients with an immune disorder combined with PAH have a worse prognosis and higher mortality compared with patients with other PAH subtypes. Moreover, data recorded worldwide show that the prevalence of PAH in women is 2\u00d7 to even 4\u00d7 higher than in men, and the ratio of PAH associated with autoimmune diseases is even higher (9:1). Sexual dimorphism in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease was explained for many years by the action of female sex hormones. However, there are increasing reports of interactions between sex hormones and sex chromosomes, and differences in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease may be controlled not only by sex hormones but also by sex chromosome pathways that are not dependent on the gonads. This review discusses the role of estrogen and genetic factors including the role of genes located on the X chromosome, as well as the potential protective role of the Y chromosome in sexual dimorphism, which is prominent in the occurrence of PAH associated with autoimmune diseases. Moreover, an overview of animal models that could potentially play a role in further investigating the aforementioned link was also reviewed.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.2105\/ajph.2024.307719","title":["Advancing Equity in Local Health Departments: An Inside-Out Approach"],"author":[{"suffix":"Jr","given":"Marvin H.","family":"Ward","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"All authors are with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, Raleigh."}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0000-6788-9332","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Karen","family":"Stanley","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"All authors are with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, Raleigh."}]},{"given":"Georgia S.","family":"Childs","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"All authors are with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, Raleigh."}]},{"given":"Lakecia D.","family":"Owens","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"All authors are with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, Raleigh."}]},{"given":"Breyana","family":"Davis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"All authors are with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section, Raleigh."}]}],"abstract":"<jats:p> The North Carolina Division of Public Health, Chronic Disease and Injury Section recommends local health departments (LHDs) adopt an \u201cinside-out\u201d approach to advance health and racial equity.

However, ICSs carry potential infection risks, particularly nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). This study investigated the association between ICS use and NTM infection risk using national insurance data, particularly for individuals with chronic airway diseases.Methods: We conducted a nationwide population-based study using data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea from 2002 to 2019. The cohort included 57,553 patients diagnosed with COPD or asthma. To assess the risk of NTM infection, we used Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to ensure a balanced analysis of covariates.Results: Of the 57,553 patients (mean age 56.0 years, 43.2% male), 16.5% used ICS and 83.5% did not. We identified 63 NTM infection cases, including nine among ICS users and 54 among non-users. Before and after IPTW, ICS use was associated with a higher risk of NTM infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 4.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 15.58). Higher risks were significant for patients \u226565 years (adjusted HR, 6.40; 95% CI, 1.28 to 31.94), females (adjusted HR, 10.91; 95% CI, 2.24 to 53.20), never-smokers (adjusted HR, 6.31; 95% CI, 1.49 to 26.64), systemic steroid users (adjusted HR, 50.19; 95% CI, 8.07 to 312.19), and those with higher comorbidity scores (adjusted HR, 6.64; 95% CI, 1.19 to 37.03).Conclusion: ICS use in patients with chronic airway diseases might increase the risk of NTM infection, particularly in older females, never-smokers, and systemic steroid users.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"DOI":"10.4046\/trd.2024.0044","title":["Pulmonary Function, Functional Capacity, Respiratory, and Locomotor Muscle Strength after Severe to Critically Ill COVID-19: A Long-Term Study"],"author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0007-9178-3811","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Thanunya","family":"Ngamsutham","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4459-7681","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Warawut","family":"Chaiwong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sauwaluk","family":"Dacha","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Patraporn","family":"Sitilertpisan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chaicharn","family":"Pothirat","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pilaiporn","family":"Duangjit","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Athavudh","family":"Deesomchok","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chalerm","family":"Liwsrisakun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Chaiwat","family":"Bumroongkit","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Theerakorn","family":"Theerakittikul","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Atikun","family":"Limsukon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Konlawij","family":"Trongtrakul","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nutchanok","family":"Niyatiwatchanchai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4409-1832","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Pattraporn","family":"Tajarernmuang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Background: The sequelae of post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia on lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life were observed in both shortterm and long-term.

Therefore, we aimed to examine long-term pulmonary function, functional capacities, and respiratory and locomotor body muscle strength in severe to critically ill post-COVID-19 survivors.Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in 22 post-COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy adults. Clinical characteristics during admission, pulmonary function, functional capacity, respiratory muscles, and locomotor muscles strength were examined at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge from the hospital.Results: The generalized linear mixed model showed that percent predicted of forced expiratory volume in the 1 second (%FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;\/sub&gt;), percent predicted of forced vital capacity (%FVC), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), handgrip strength, 6-minute walk distance, and five times sit to stand (5TSTS) were significantly lower in post-COVID-19 pneumonia patients than in healthy subjects during the follow-up period.

To validate clinical implication of the identified biomarkers, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on 48 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissue specimens, and the correlation with clinical parameters was evaluated.Results: We identified 500 genes overexpressed in tumor tissue compared to those in normal tissue. Among them, &lt;i&gt;UCHL1&lt;\/i&gt;, brain expressed X-linked 3 (&lt;i&gt;BEX3&lt;\/i&gt;), and midkine (&lt;i&gt;MDK&lt;\/i&gt;), which are associated with tumor growth and progression, exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in expression compared to that in normal tissue. IHC analysis of NSCLC tissues showed that only UCHL1 was specifically overexpressed. Additionally, in 48 NSCLC specimens, UCHL1 was specifically upregulated in the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane of tumor cells. Multivariable logistic analysis identified several factors, including smoking, tumor size, and high-grade dysplasia, to be typically associated with &lt;i&gt;UCHL1&lt;\/i&gt; overexpression. Survival analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets revealed that &lt;i&gt;UCHL1&lt;\/i&gt; overexpression is substantially associated with poor survival outcomes. Furthermore, a strong association was observed between UCHL1 expression and the clinicopathological features of patients with NSCLC.Conclusion: &lt;i&gt;UCHL1&lt;\/i&gt; overexpression was associated with smoking, tumor size, and high-grade dysplasia, which are typically associated with a poor prognosis and survival outcome.

Therefore, when devising appropriate strategies for removing mechanical ventilation, it is essential to consider scientific and systematic approaches, as well as the individual experiences of healthcare professionals. Recently, numerous studies have investigated methods and tools to identify when mechanically ventilated patients are ready to breathe on their own. The Korean Society of Critical Care Medicine therefore provides these recommendations to clinicians for liberation from the ventilator.Methods: Meta-analyses and comprehensive syntheses were used to thoroughly review, compile, and summarize the complete body of relevant evidence. All studies were meticulously assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method, and the outcomes were presented succinctly as evidence profiles. These evidence syntheses were discussed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts in mechanical ventilation, who then developed and approved the recommendations.Results: Recommendations for nine questions on ventilator liberation about Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) are presented in this document. This guideline presents seven conditional recommendations, one expert consensus recommendation, and one conditional deferred recommendation.Conclusion: We developed these clinical guidelines for mechanical ventilation liberation to provide meaningful recommendations.

Given the pivotal role of the Lok Sabha in shaping India's economic policies and legislative landscape, the outcomes of these elections are expected to have substantial implications for market dynamics. Historical data analysis reveals that past elections have consistently led to increased market volatility and activity, reflecting investor sentiment towards political stability and economic policy continuity. This study employs a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, including historical data analysis, event studies, and predictive modeling, to forecast potential market reactions. Key factors such as political stability, proposed economic reforms, global economic environment, and investor sentiment are examined to understand their influence on market behavior. The 2024 elections are especially significant as they occur during a period of post-pandemic economic recovery, technological advancements, and evolving geopolitical relations. By analyzing these factors, the paper aims to provide insights into how different election outcomes might affect various sectors, investment strategies, and overall market performance. The findings are intended to aid investors in navigating the election period, making informed decisions, and understanding the broader implications of political events on economic stability and growth.

EU Legislative Implications. Applicability in Romania"],"author":[{"given":"Elise Nicoleta","family":"V\u00e2lcu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"abstract":"<jats:p>Equity crowdfunding is a technologically adapted alternative form of financing to bank financing, and also a type of intermediation in which a crowdfunding service provider, without taking risks itself, manages a digital platform, open to the general public, to connect or facilitate the connection of potential investors or lenders with the business community seeking finance. Through crowdfunding, investors can finance projects published on the crowdfunding platform either by providing loans (crowdlending) or by purchasing securities\/instruments admitted for crowdfunding purposes issued by project developers (crowd-equity). At European Union level, the provision of equity crowdfunding services is stated by Regulation (EU) 2020\/1503 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 October 2020 on European providers of equity crowdfunding services to business and amending Regulation (EU) 2017\/1129 and Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 (\u201cRegulation (EU) 1503\/2020\u201d) and by delegated regulations of the European Commission which approved the regulatory technical standards drawn up by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). In Romania, in order to properly implement the EU legislative framework, Law no 244 of 20 April 2022 on measures implementing the Regulation (EU) 1503\/2020. The present research aims at highlighting a number of issues for reflection, among which we mention by way of example: (i) the interpretation of the term \u201ccommercial activity or activities\u201d in the context of the Regulation (EU) 1503\/2020; (ii) the typologies of crowdfunding providers, their role in the crowdfunding mechanism, but also to what extent are they entitled to accept only sophisticated investors? doctrinal implications; (iii) minimum prudential requirements laid down by the EU legislator in Regulation (EU) 1503\/2020 to the effect that a crowdfunding provider is required to have prudential safeguards in place at all times; (iv) to what extent can a project owner market their crowdfunding projects? (v) the particular nature of the activity of providers of equity financing services authorised in a Member State of the European Union who may provide equity financing services in a Member State other than the Member State whose competent authority granted the authorisation, on the basis of a simplified procedure (license passporting) involving notification to the competent authority of the Member State which granted the authorisation of the intention to provide equity financing services in other Member States of the European Union, etc. In summary of the above, we believe that, as an expression of the age of artificial intelligence, the crowdfunding market, both at EU level and in the particular case of Romania, shows an upward trend, characterised by the fact that both investors and project developers are increasingly interested in crowdfunding services and in the way crowdfunding platforms operate.

This article reveals and presents a view on the normative regulation of the field of scientific study and points out the shortcomings of the regulation of the judicial protection of rights in health care in the Republic of Slovenia. The study concludes that the interference with a patient's right protected by law results in an interference with the patient's private life, which is why the court should mitigate the ongoing violation and its consequences without undue delay. The patient should be able to seek judicial protection of his or her rights in the healthcare system within the national system through the establishment of an institute of just satisfaction under Article 41 The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

This is enshrined in section 10 of the Penal Code, as long as the omitting person has a personal legal duty to act as guarantor (section 10, no. 2). In medical criminal liability, the framework for a hypothetical omission by an on-duty doctor in emergency services has been controversial. In our legal system, section 284 of the Penal Code expressly stipulates that a doctor\u2019s refusal to administer care be punishable conduct. On the other hand, it is possible that the doctor on duty in the emergency room of a hospital has a personal legal duty to act as a guarantor, arising from the contract that binds him\/her to the hospital. Thus, it is necessary to affirm a subsidiarity relation between the mechanism of equating omission with action resulting from section 10 of the Penal Code and incrimination under section 284 of the Penal Code. However, this has not been the major understanding of the jurisprudence of the Portuguese courts on this subject. For instance, when the refusal of assistance by a doctor causes the death of a patient, instead of convicting the doctor for homicide by omission (section 131 of the Portuguese Penal Code, ex vi section 10, numbers 1 and 2), courts are convicting as per section 284 \u2013 refusal of the medical doctor to provide medical assistance. The present work aims to critically present this jurisprudence, state the legal and doctrinal foundations that justify the inclusion of these hypotheses within the scope of crimes committed by omission and point out the practical importance of choosing this solution.

By an \u2018emergency situation\u2019 the authoress means \u2018overall exceptional circumstances caused by special, rare events, unforeseen in an accepted time perspective, in which someone or something was (is) at a certain time\u2019. Until the outbreak of Covid-19, the subject matter of legal regulation of employment relationships in connection with the occurrence of emergency situations has not been given much thought (in our legal circle). This is also relevant to emergencies other than epidemics (warfare, natural disasters, force majeure, etc.). Insofar as research has been conducted to date, it rather focused on substantive and legal aspects of the regulations implemented in connection with the occurrence of such events, while any broader reflection on their formal and legal model has not been conducted. For this reason, in this paper, the authoress has firstly advanced a thesis that a distinction needs to be made between substantive and formal and legal models for the regulation of employment relationships in emergency situations, and secondly an attempt has been made to answer the question of which formal models can be distinguished in this context, what criteria should be used in this endeavour and how, on this basis, the distinguished models should be assessed. The authoress puts forward a thesis that formal models of \u2018emergency\u2019 labour law are closely linked to the concern to uphold the elementary democratic standards which should be respected by the law regardless of whether it relates to \u2018ordinary\u2019 or extraordinary situations. The research is primarily based on an analytical and linguistic, analytical and logical, dogmatic and legal, and descriptive method. It is conducted mainly on the example of the regulations of the Polish law and the decision of the Polish legislator taken in connection with the Covid-19 outbreak in relation to the method for the regulation of employment relationships during the period covered by it. However, the context of international (convention) regulations is also referred to. The authoress proposes to distinguish three basic formal models for the regulation of employment relationships in emergency situations: the permanent model, the mixed model and the ad hoc model. She concludes that, taking into account both the need for a relative flexibility in legal regulation and the need to maintain the elementary standards of a democratic state of law (primarily a guarantee that the applied legal solutions can be subjected to social discussion and dialogue between social partners), the mixed model should be considered as the most optimal.

It critically examines these notions to diverge from the conventional practice of parliamentary sovereignty in instances of power abuse. The term \u2018elective dictatorship\u2019 describes a scenario where an elected political party wields substantial power without effective checks and balances, leading to a concentration of power within the ruling party. This situation raises concerns about the erosion of democratic principles and potential power abuse. Closely linked to this is the concept of partisan politics, where alignment with a particular political party leads to abuses of power, challenging the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Various factors contribute to this dynamic, including ideological, social, and economic considerations. In a healthy democracy, political parties play a crucial role in representing diverse interests and offering voters choices. However, when partisan politics becomes overly polarised and prioritises gaining and maintaining power at any cost, it can foster an elective dictatorship. This article reviews existing literature in this domain and addresses these concepts within the context of the rule of law and ethics. It aims to fill a gap in the literature by establishing the conceptual parameters for \u2018elective dictatorship\u2019 and \u2018partisan Politics\u2019, and argues that when both are used to undermine the judiciary, the court has a duty to depart from traditional norms. It further recommends that courts assess any legislation enacted by the government and Parliament against the rule of law, morality, and ethics.

However, the extent of embedding the prostate has long been a subject of debate, with some advocating partial\/selective embedding and others favoring complete embedding. This study establishes a standardized and time-efficient protocol for processing radical prostatectomy specimens with limited embedding while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Two hundred twenty-six prostatectomy specimens were analyzed, and the results of a highly standardized selective embedding protocol, systematically embedding the apex, the base, the transition to the seminal vesicles, and selected horizontal sections, were compared with full embedding as the gold standard. Non-inferiority testing was conducted by one-sided binomial tests and Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals. Selective embedding provided consistent and accurate diagnostic information with up to 90\u201398% concordance in pT, margins, ISUP-grade groups, and presence of IDC-P and cribriform tumor growth. In summary, this study establishes an economical standardized protocol for selective embedding of radical prostatectomy specimens with only minimal loss of information.<\/jats:p>","container-title":["Virchows Archiv"]},{"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10]]},"DOI":"10.1308\/rcsfdj.2024.40","title":["Involving children and young people in supportive cancer care research: the value of FDS grant funding and charitable partnerships"],"author":[{"given":"Claudia","family":"Heggie","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Leeds, UK"}]},{"given":"Natalie","family":"Kisby","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Candlelighters Trust, UK"}]},{"given":"Peter","family":"Day","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Leeds, UK"}]},{"given":"Bob","family":"Phillips","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of York, UK"}]}],"abstract":"<jats:sec><jats:title>INTRODUCTION<\/jats:title><jats:p> Involvement of children and young people in research has a multitude of benefits for children, researchers and the quality of the research itself.

On early Earth, replication is challenged by the dilution of molecular building blocks and the difficulty of separating daughter from parent strands, a necessity for exponential replication. While thermal gradient systems have been shown to address these problems, elevated temperatures lead to degradation. Also, compared to constant temperature environments, such systems are rare. The isothermal system studied here models an abundant geological environment of the prebiotic Earth, in which water is continuously evaporated at the point of contact with the gas flows, inducing up-concentration and circular flow patterns at the gas-water interface through momentum transfer. We show experimentally that this setting drives a 30-fold accumulation of nucleic acids and their periodic separation by a 3-fold reduction in salt and product concentration. Fluid dynamic simulations agree with observations from tracking fluorescent beads. In this isothermal system, we were able to drive exponential DNA replication with Taq polymerase. The results provide a model for a ubiquitous non-equilibrium system to host early Darwinian molecular evolution at constant temperature.<\/jats:p>"}],"items-per-page":1000,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
